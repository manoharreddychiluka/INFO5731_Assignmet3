1,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero offers what most fans of the saga come looking for: energetic action, new transformations, and the classic Akira Toriyama humor that works brilliantly in this film.The risk and courage in creating a narrative focused on Gohan, Piccolo, and Pan turn out to be successful due to the more intimate context, but it's still quite far from the epic levels and supreme satisfaction of the last movie.Exaggerated fan service leads to unjustified, absurd new forms. The pacing and balance of the different storylines and relationships lack better control. The fight sequences have good moments, but some abrupt cuts take away some of the dazzle. And finally, 3D animation proves to be a massive decline in almost every aspect compared to the ideal mix used in recent content.It's a pleasant, light, fun adventure but sadly unfulfilling.""Rating: B-",enjoy reading spoilerfree thoughts please follow blog read full review dragon ball super super hero offers fans saga come looking energetic action new transformations classic akira toriyama humor works brilliantly filmthe risk courage creating narrative focused gohan piccolo pan turn successful due intimate context still quite far epic levels supreme satisfaction last movieexaggerated fan service leads unjustified absurd new forms pacing balance different storylines relationships lack better control fight sequences good moments abrupt cuts take away dazzle finally animation proves massive decline almost every aspect compared ideal mix used recent contentits pleasant light fun adventure sadly unfulfillingrating b
2,"Giving the fact that you gave more screen time for the Red Ribbon organization just amazes me. Especially for Piccolo and Gohan.I never actually thought that this movie will have a plot and connections to the original tv series. Normally Dragon ball will have comedy and unnecessary subplots.I love the fact that this movie was engaging and the flow was spot on. The fights and manipulation were great in this movie. Seeing Gohan fight was extraordinary well done.The only flaw was Bulma and her usefulness on the Dragon ball felt slightly annoying. However, the fight with Vegeta and Goku, in hand to hand combat made me feel very happy indeed.I was surprised that I saw this movie. I am glad I watched it again.",giving fact gave screen time red ribbon organization amazes especially piccolo gohani never actually thought movie plot connections original tv series normally dragon ball comedy unnecessary subplotsi love fact movie engaging flow spot fights manipulation great movie seeing gohan fight extraordinary well donethe flaw bulma usefulness dragon ball felt slightly annoying however fight vegeta goku hand hand combat made feel happy indeedi surprised saw movie glad watched
3,"The CGI animation is definitely going to be a turnoff for most who liked the far more polished look of the Broly film.Assuming that is not a problem be prepared for a very long and overall dull buildup. There's a lot of talking in the first half of the movie since the bad guys keep flashing back to previous events and plotting their next move.Once that is over they finally create two androids that magically match in power Gohan and Piccolo. Don't ask why, it was already a stretch to have androids with more power than Super Saiyan back in the Android Saga. The Red Ribbon can simply collect data and create androids that are as powerful as the current heroes with no cap. Go figure.The fight between the heroes and the new androids is tensionless since nothing feels like it's at stake. The world doesn't look like it's in danger and even Pan fools around when she gets kidnapped just for motivating her daddy to try harder. The final boss ends up being a buffed up Cell. Don't get too excited, because he's in his second form and completely mindless compared to his predecessor. The battle is eventually won with the heroes getting new transformations (Piccolo turns yellow because of his age and the dragon, Gohan gets longer silver hair for protecting a daughter that was never in any real danger). Then the villains turn allies because it's a show for kids.As for the power houses of the show, Goku and Vegeta spend the whole movie at Beerus' place, training along with Broly. And don't expect something to come out of all that, they are not doing much and they conveniently never find out about what happens on Earth.The movie as a whole looks like it was made to match the Dokan gatcha game. Its gamers will appreciate it far more than plain watchers. The plot is nothing to bother thinking about, the new power ups are lazy, and there's not much to get from it besides an excuse for more units in the gatcha. An overall bellow average movie in a franchise that is way beyond its prime and runs purely on milking nostalgia.",cgi animation definitely going turnoff liked far polished look broly filmassuming problem prepared long overall dull buildup theres lot talking first half movie since bad guys keep flashing back previous events plotting next moveonce finally create two androids magically match power gohan piccolo dont ask already stretch androids power super saiyan back android saga red ribbon simply collect data create androids powerful current heroes cap go figurethe fight heroes new androids tensionless since nothing feels like stake world doesnt look like danger even pan fools around gets kidnapped motivating daddy try harder final boss ends buffed cell dont get excited hes second form completely mindless compared predecessor battle eventually heroes getting new transformations piccolo turns yellow age dragon gohan gets longer silver hair protecting daughter never real danger villains turn allies show kidsas power houses show goku vegeta spend whole movie beerus place training along broly dont expect something come much conveniently never find happens earththe movie whole looks like made match dokan gatcha game gamers appreciate far plain watchers plot nothing bother thinking new power ups lazy theres much get besides excuse units gatcha overall bellow average movie franchise way beyond prime runs purely milking nostalgia
4,"GrandmaI wasn't expecting anything, but I loved it.The CGI is something that still doesn't quite convince me, but I think they didn't do it badly. There were scenes with too good visual art, and some amazing battle choreographies and explosions.I liked the story, but everything felt too short, I would have liked to see more and I feel that the best thing was that the main characters were Gohan and Piccoro to give a refreshing touch to the Dragon Ball story in general. The comedy, as always, is very good, the serious moments feel so good, for example the final part.Being honest, I hope they don't use CGI again, I prefer 2D, but I loved the movie enough to watch it more than once.",grandmai wasnt expecting anything loved itthe cgi something still doesnt quite convince think didnt badly scenes good visual art amazing battle choreographies explosionsi liked story everything felt short would liked see feel best thing main characters gohan piccoro give refreshing touch dragon ball story general comedy always good serious moments feel good example final partbeing honest hope dont use cgi prefer loved movie enough watch
5,"I'm fully aware this movie gets a lot of hate, though I can't understand why, it's within their right to have such feeling. Personally, I enjoy watching it. 2D animation will always be a better alternative but this 3D graphics isn't bad either, I have a good time watching the full action scenes which almost doesn't give us any room to breath, the choreography is excellent too. Story-wise nothing special about it, the ending's kinda cliche too, well I mean, Dragon Ball cliche, it wouldn't be a Dragon Ball movie without such ending. The villains somehow are a little bit underwhelming, without so much of a character development, but it's nice to see both Piccolo and Gohan get the spotlight sometimes, so not so bad at all, but not great either.8/10.",im fully aware movie gets lot hate though cant understand within right feeling personally enjoy watching animation always better alternative graphics isnt bad either good time watching full action scenes almost doesnt give us room breath choreography excellent storywise nothing special endings kinda cliche well mean dragon ball cliche wouldnt dragon ball movie without ending villains somehow little bit underwhelming without much character development nice see piccolo gohan get spotlight sometimes bad great either

7,"If you had told me that Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero would be a good Dragon Ball film, I would have told you that you were spouting nonsense. This film's trailers were not promising at all: the full CG animation, another attempt to bring back the Red Ribbon, and what looks to be a cash-grab given how successful anime films have been recently (e.g. Demon Slayer Mugen Train and Jujutsu Kaisen 0). I was worried about this film and the fate of the upcoming Slam Dunk film. And I am so glad this movie proved me wrong.First and foremost, the animation. Although I liked Dragon Ball Super Broly, I was not the biggest fan of the video-game-like animation in some of the fight scenes in that film. However, Super Hero's CG animation was not distracting at all to me. Sure, it may have taken a couple of minutes to get used to it, but for the most part, I'd say Toei had done a pretty decent job. And if you have seen other CG animes like Beastars or Land of the Lustrous, then this film would not be anything novel to you. But, I'd still like to see a hand-drawn film should Toei decide to make a sequel. 2D animation just hits different.Regarding the story, it was a pretty basic 3-act structure. But then again, no one should walk into a Dragon Ball film expecting any major plot twists or shocking revelations. There are certain nitpicks regarding Piccolo's plan in the second act or how the Red Ribbon is still a powerful organization despite the fact that it's been confirmed to be mostly gone after Goku's heroics in the OG series. You will find it quite enjoyable you don't think too hard about it.The fight scenes were quite solid this time around. The choreography, the lighting, and camera movements were all on point. Honestly, I got chills quite a few times during the third act (or it could just be the AC in the theaters).And lastly, the characters. If you are here expecting some Goku and Vegeta action, you may be disappointed because they were barely in the film. But I, on the other hand, loved it. It's so refreshing to see Gohan and Piccolo get the spotlight again, and the movie sure gave them the much- needed return after being reduced to mostly background characters in the Dragon Ball Super manga. The Androids looked silly in the posters, but fortunately, they were really fun to watch (they almost made me cry towards the end as well). And Pan, what a cutie! She's easily the cutest kid character in Dragon Ball since young Goku himself. More of her, please. Thanks to this film, I hope the next one will turn the attention to the likes of Yamcha and Tienshinhan (especially Yamcha) as well.All in all, if you are a Dragon Ball fan, I think you will have a good time with this film (if you can tolerate the CG animation or don't overthink the plot).P/S: There's an after-credit scene, so stay till the end!",told dragon ball super super hero would good dragon ball film would told spouting nonsense films trailers promising full cg animation another attempt bring back red ribbon looks cashgrab given successful anime films recently eg demon slayer mugen train jujutsu kaisen worried film fate upcoming slam dunk film glad movie proved wrongfirst foremost animation although liked dragon ball super broly biggest fan videogamelike animation fight scenes film however super heros cg animation distracting sure may taken couple minutes get used part id say toei done pretty decent job seen cg animes like beastars land lustrous film would anything novel id still like see handdrawn film toei decide make sequel animation hits differentregarding story pretty basic act structure one walk dragon ball film expecting major plot twists shocking revelations certain nitpicks regarding piccolos plan second act red ribbon still powerful organization despite fact confirmed mostly gone gokus heroics og series find quite enjoyable dont think hard itthe fight scenes quite solid time around choreography lighting camera movements point honestly got chills quite times third act could ac theatersand lastly characters expecting goku vegeta action may disappointed barely film hand loved refreshing see gohan piccolo get spotlight movie sure gave much needed return reduced mostly background characters dragon ball super manga androids looked silly posters fortunately really fun watch almost made cry towards end well pan cutie shes easily cutest kid character dragon ball since young goku please thanks film hope next one turn attention likes yamcha tienshinhan especially yamcha wellall dragon ball fan think good time film tolerate cg animation dont overthink plotps theres aftercredit scene stay till end
8,"Solid film . Great action , likeable characters, and awesome moments . People will always find ways to pick apart anything dragonball related but if you go into this with an open mind and to simply just watch some new dragonball content you'll be extremely satisfied . The new animation is fantastic during fight scenes and the characters hold very true to the anime. You'll see a ton of negative reviews complaining about the new style but after about 5 minutes in to the movie you'll hardly even realise it's CGI it stays that true to the 2D animation stuff. The humour worked well and the action scenes are up there with the best in the series (have no clue why people are complaining about this). I'll admit it's not as good as the Broly movie but is fantastic in its own right . Go Piccolo and Gohan, 2 neglected characters who really show off what they are capable of.",solid film great action likeable characters awesome moments people always find ways pick apart anything dragonball related go open mind simply watch new dragonball content youll extremely satisfied new animation fantastic fight scenes characters hold true anime youll see ton negative reviews complaining new style minutes movie youll hardly even realise cgi stays true animation stuff humour worked well action scenes best series clue people complaining ill admit good broly movie fantastic right go piccolo gohan neglected characters really show capable
9,"So to begin with because IMdB seems to be funky as all heck (see not a swear word) I have to preface that even when I put spoilers on I have to say ""there will be spoilers here.""So let's go into it.The latest movie outing for Dragon Ball has a lot going for it, from killer visuals to a decent score, the problem is as is evident from my 5 star that this is a rather badly done story.We begin with a hitherto unknown grandson of Dr Gero who is just as smart and just as skilled with robotics as he was, who stole corpses and reanimated them to work at a convenience store and was arrested and put in prison for 3 months. He's hired by the son of Commander Red (called Magenta) to build new androids to ""help save the world from the evil Capsule Corp and their alien menace""
this is part good and part bad, the good is the manipulation of events seen from the outside as it would look fishy how aliens are around capsule corp and they're the biggest richest and best company in the world.The bad is the need to make connections to prior characters, rather than have the Doctor Hedo be related to Gero, have him be a survivor of East City and have him be obsessed with defeating aliens and villains that way while having his benefactor be a rival for Capsule Corp that we just don't know about who see's an opportunity to control a gullible fool.The base plot is that though, the misunderstanding of Hedo to create cyborgs for the restarted Red Ribbon Army, we get transformations from Gohan and Piccolo including the always demanded Gohan Blanco and now the new ""Orange Piccolo"" for some reason. Goten and Trunks are teenagers now and Goku and Vegeta are off on Beerus Planet fighting (Vegete wins).It culminates in a Form 2 remade Cell going berserk and trying to destroy the world with no gravitas or point, he's just there because Cell is Gohans biggest enemy and we need to keep branding.This isn't a good outing - at all.And I wondered why they did the CGI fest for this, with 3D models rather than drawn characters, well I know now and its purely for the spectacle, there's things done easier in 3D than in hand drawn here that ""look"" good aesthetically but are just the air in the sugared popcorn, it's not got any meaning to it than to go ""wow"" to.And I'd rather have my animated films be less empty ""wow"" and more detailed artistry. It didn't take as much effort to make this as it would have otherwise.So no, not a good one in my book, a fail for Toei and a continuing black eye for the Dragon Ball franchiseNow let's check and see if I've insulted a person or said a swear word and nope...not at all, so it should be allowed, right?

13,"Surprisingly heart felt story. Gohan, and Piccolo being the main focus of this flick was a great choice, as their dynamic has been lacking for awhile now up until this point. Super throwback to the first season of DBZ. Gohan finally confronts his lack of training, and we get to witness him actually take charge, as he sets out on his mission alone. The 3D animation is a welcomed addition to this franchise. The ending was somewhat abrupt, but tied up nicely with the post credit scene. I understand wanting to give other characters shine besides Goku/Vegeta, however I think they could've utilized them more efficiently within this story. Overall this is a perfect addition to this franchise, and we get oh so closer to the End of Z time period. Seeing teenage Trunks/Goten was the cherry on top for me.",surprisingly heart felt story gohan piccolo main focus flick great choice dynamic lacking awhile point super throwback first season dbz gohan finally confronts lack training get witness actually take charge sets mission alone animation welcomed addition franchise ending somewhat abrupt tied nicely post credit scene understand wanting give characters shine besides gokuvegeta however think couldve utilized efficiently within story overall perfect addition franchise get oh closer end z time period seeing teenage trunksgoten cherry top
14,"I thought the Broly movie was bad. But this? THIS? This takes the cake. All Dragon Ball Super: Superhero is, is a reboot of the entire Android and Cell sagas and a very terrible reboot with a few tweaks and different characters thrown into the mix. I knew from watching the trailers this movie looked awful but I wanted to see it for myself to really may a fair judgement and review. Yikes is all I could thinkThe Red Ribbon Army making another comeback, using Dr. Gero's grandson to make stronger androids and even a terrible Cell reboot character known as Cell Max who is Cell in his Semi Perfect Form but a giant with red and green colours. The Androids themselves - Gamma 1 and Gamma 2 superhero wannabe knockoffs who are misguided and turned good in the end. AwfulWhat's even worse is when Bulma made a wish to make her ass bigger. Are you kidding me? How stupid and pointless is that!. Granted Bulma can be a little vain but it was never....never to this degree before. It was completely out of character and there's so much more to her than just being thick. She's feisty, smart, funny, beautiful and everything in between. She was just used as comedic relief in very bad taste and just to appeal to the thirsty Dragon Ball fans that look at her onlineThe humour is awful and felt forced and too cheesy. There were some moments that made laugh but not always. Dragon Ball is known for it's humour in serious situations but usually it's organic and actually funny. This entire movie wasn'tI did like the fact this movie was mainly focused on Piccolo and Gohan instead of Goku and Vegeta who only make minor appearances. That was cool. But the plot was just utter garbage. Again they rehashed the plot of Gohan being too weak, he isn't strong as he used to be. Got to make him strong again. Got to push him past his limit and he does and gets a new form. Like we haven't seen that beforeIt was also cool seeing Pan being trained by Piccolo. Overall this movie was an embarrassment and as a life long Dragon Ball Fan that loves Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT and some parts of Dragon Ball Super.

16,"This film was just a disappointment. Let's start with the artwork; I'm not going to bash the overall art style, when you start watching you just get used to it so it's not that bad, but some of the design choices are just awful. Cell looks like a Christmas decoration, Gohan's new powerup design is lame, and Piccolo.. he just makes me want to throw up it's so bad. Story wise, it's not great imo. I never liked the Gohan superhero arc in dbz so I can easily say I was biased from the start, but I just didn't enjoy it.Overall: this coming after dbs Broly is a huge letdown.

18,"I know plenty of reviews have already mentioned it, the new animation really doesn't look bad, but it definitely does feel a bit like a cutscene from a game at certain parts. For the most part though it's not that big of a deal.My biggest issue with the animation style was actually Dr Hedo, his character design looked a little out of place. Some characters are more classic cartoon villains like Commander Magenta who I thought was an excellent design, much like earlier Dragonball villains. Whereas the main characters feel much closer to humans than charicatures, but Dr Hedo kind of falls in between those styles.As a character I felt much the same, his drive to make superheroes while siding with the villains (originally at least) and his change in attitude towards the end doesn't quite work as well. Especially since Gamma 1&2 make that turn better and it made a lot more sense for them to do so because they really did think they were the heroes. Hedo however admitted he knew he was wrong from the start.I'll admit I have a great soft spot for Cell, so was glad to see him return again in some form. A little let down that he wasn't much of a character, he just kind of grunts and screams. Plus he appeared to be an adaptation of 2nd form Cell which, personally my least favourite form. But the design looks pretty good and the fight itself has a lot of good moments.It probably sounds like i've been overly critical so far, so i'll finish with what I really loved about this. The humour is top notch and fits perfectly with what you expect from DB, the movie took a route I always want and in multiple ways. They finally did a story with Goku and Vegeta, but the heroes were essentially everyone else and they weren't just bystanders they all played an important part in winning the fight. On a similar note we finally got a transformation/upgrade for Piccolo who is a character who has always deserved it. They also had great Gohan appreciation and almost a return to his older power plus it is a great thumbs up that he used one of Piccolo's attacks one which is also acknowleged by Piccolo himself.Finally this movie called back a lot to different parts of the history and lore, and it added to it. Despite being a fan of Dragonball since the 90's, the emotional scenes still make me misty eyed. Seeing Gohan fight for Pan or Piccolo, seeing Piccolo training Pan. Seeing Krillin's hesitation to fight but overcoming it to save 18 and help his friends? Those are parts I will always love.",know plenty reviews already mentioned new animation really doesnt look bad definitely feel bit like cutscene game certain parts part though big dealmy biggest issue animation style actually dr hedo character design looked little place characters classic cartoon villains like commander magenta thought excellent design much like earlier dragonball villains whereas main characters feel much closer humans charicatures dr hedo kind falls stylesas character felt much drive make superheroes siding villains originally least change attitude towards end doesnt quite work well especially since gamma make turn better made lot sense really think heroes hedo however admitted knew wrong startill admit great soft spot cell glad see return form little let wasnt much character kind grunts screams plus appeared adaptation nd form cell personally least favourite form design looks pretty good fight lot good momentsit probably sounds like ive overly critical far ill finish really loved humour top notch fits perfectly expect db movie took route always want multiple ways finally story goku vegeta heroes essentially everyone else werent bystanders played important part winning fight similar note finally got transformationupgrade piccolo character always deserved also great gohan appreciation almost return older power plus great thumbs used one piccolos attacks one also acknowleged piccolo himselffinally movie called back lot different parts history lore added despite fan dragonball since emotional scenes still make misty eyed seeing gohan fight pan piccolo seeing piccolo training pan seeing krillins hesitation fight overcoming save help friends parts always love

It was a treat for all of us who had Piccolo and Gohan as some of the most beloved characters during DBZ and definitely saw them not being so important in Super up until now. Seeing so many references from the DBZ Androids/Cell saga even from the original DB was really cool as we entered a new era of Dragon Ball and most of the new fans who got introduced to the franchise from the Super era probably don't know the significance of some of the moves/forms were used in this movie, especially the finishing move! Dragon Ball is alive and kicking and I have a feeling this is only the beginning.Am I the only one who's sensing they are gonna use these new forms of Gohan and Piccolo along with Goku's UI and Vegeta's UE and also let's not forget Broly into something far greater? Possibly a new tournament of power or kind of event against something crazy?

23,"The previous Dragon Ball Super movie, Broly, was enjoyable with amazing animation, but I thought it was missing something in terms of story. Ultimately, I came out of it thinking I may have grown out of Dragon Ball a bit.This movie, which I wasn't expecting much from, proved that thought wrong. It was hilarious, heartfelt, interesting, and filled with fan service.Dragon Ball was getting really stale due to it just being Goku and Vegeta continuously getting stronger while everyone else was left in the background. However, this movie is basically an action-comedy about Piccolo figuring out how to protect Earth without those two around. After nearly the entirety of Super being focused on them, this was a huge surprise.Piccolo going undercover as he tries to get Gohan to unleash his potential again is so much fun to watch. This premise also allows the movie to be a redemption story for Gohan, giving both him and Piccolo new power boosts that most likely put them back on a comparable scale with Goku and Vegeta for future stories.Gohan is super sick here. He has had multiple arcs where he regains his strength, but here he realizes that even though his father is alive nowadays, he still won't always be there to protect Earth. As long as the cycle of Gohan lacking on his training doesn't repeat yet again, I'm really pleased with this arc.Of course, what makes the story possible is the villains who are a pretty cool concept. The Androids are my favorite villains in all of Dragon Ball, so more of the Red Ribbon Army is great. Their secret base was cool and their viewing of the Z-Warriors as evil alien invaders was very entertaining.I thought Dr. Hedo was silly, but Gamma 1 & 2 were way cooler than I thought they would be. Their superhero gags were hilarious.Admittedly I didn't care for Cell Max. He felt like Cell version of Bio Broly which isn't ideal at all. However, he fulfills his purpose in this story. While it may have been less creative and switched the focus, I would've liked to have seen the return of the original Cell.Another thing I love about this movie is that on top of Gohan and Piccolo being the protagonists for once, we actually get a large cast here. This is a big improvement over most of Super.Seeing 18 fighting (though I wish we got more about her reaction to the return of the Red Ribbon Army) was awesome. So was seeing grown-up Goten and Trunks. Pan was super cute and likable. We, of course, also still get to catch up with Goku and co. On Beerus' planet, which was a fun side plot that excited me for what's to come for these characters.There were still some oddly omitted characters like Tien and especially 17. Plus, I'm so sick of Buu falling asleep every single story, but you can't make the cast of a single movie too bloated I guess.Anyway, everyone gets their time to shine in fights, and there are some super unique moves and camera angles. This is due to the pseudo-3D animation giving them a lot of liberty to allow for cool effects and visual depth. However, at times it borderline looks pixelated and like a video game. Still, I wouldn't hold the animation style against the movie too much. It's passable and at some points, I understand why they chose the look.Overall, this is definitely the best Dragon Ball Super movie and one of my favorite Dragon Ball movies ever.

24,"Out of the three Dragon Ball movies to come out of the modern era, this is by far the weakest. We have gone from the spectacular animation of DBS Broly to a CGI focused, frankly janky take on Dragon Ball.So many movements just feel awkward and the classic impact from hits is completely gone. Any OG Dragon Ball fan will be disappointed when they compare it with any of the classic scenes and find the weight within combat sorely lacking.Though it must be said , the CGI IS INDEED SUPERIOR to the CGI we saw in previous movies, but it does not even touch the 2D animation peak of DBS Broly. That is not a fault of the technology, plenty of movies like the Kung Fu Panda trilogy and Spiderman have shown us amazing 3D combat in a complex manner.The story is also just a recycled clone of older Dragon Ball arcs with copy cat moments in every step of the way, completely giving away the plot to any fan of the show and progressing in a sad manner with uninspired transformation with 0 creativity. THE BEST part of the movie is simply the growth of Trunks and Goten in terms of design and that is it.I will not be buying this movie in physical form, 1 showing at the Cinema was enough torture for me.",three dragon ball movies come modern era far weakest gone spectacular animation dbs broly cgi focused frankly janky take dragon ballso many movements feel awkward classic impact hits completely gone og dragon ball fan disappointed compare classic scenes find weight within combat sorely lackingthough must said cgi indeed superior cgi saw previous movies even touch animation peak dbs broly fault technology plenty movies like kung fu panda trilogy spiderman shown us amazing combat complex mannerthe story also recycled clone older dragon ball arcs copy cat moments every step way completely giving away plot fan show progressing sad manner uninspired transformation creativity best part movie simply growth trunks goten terms design iti buying movie physical form showing cinema enough torture

26,"Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero (2022) is a movie my daughter and I saw in theatres last night. The storyline follows an evil corporation that partners with a young boy genius to create androids that can help them take over the world. Goku, Piccolo and friends will need to come out of retirement and save the world again.This movie is directed by Tetsuro Kodama in his directorial debut and contains the voices of Masako Nozawa (Star Wars: Visions), Toshio Furukawa (Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow), Yûko Minaguchi (Skeleton Knight), Ryô Horikawa (Legends of the Galactic Heroes) and Aya Hisakawa (Fruits Basket).The animation in this is outstanding, especially the fight and flying scenes. The characters are well portrayed and their interactions were entertaining and funny. The writing was solid, not great but the dialogue was worthwhile. The final fights with the androids and the boss was absolutely awesome.Overall, this isn't a masterpiece but is entertaining and worth a watch.

It's clear they have to review favorably or they'll lose their access.The story is just abysmal, flat out abysmal. How do we not just have fans writing and producing these movies? With this budget they would make an actual Dragonball movie and not something that would come on PBS in the mornings.I apologize, I'm just so disappointed, they just proved that there is NO WAY Dragonball can move forward without Goku and Vegeta.

29,"So, I saw this in Regal's 4DX experience. It did not make the movie better, but it made it a memorable ride.It feels like I've not seen Dragon Ball in a while but not too long because I know all the characters not new to this movie but some enemies I can't recall when they became allies.Anyway, first time I'm experiencing Dragonball with this CGI blend, which I thought was really cool, and the first Dragonball I watched in which Goku was not the main guy, so that was really interesting. Despite Piccalo doing a few things that seemed out of place, it was cool to see him take the lead in this one.These Dragonball movies are made to be a quick fix to the episodic series. In my opinion this film actually did a good job in capturing in story development how it can take 5 to 6 episodes before the fight breaks out.Overall, this was a lot of fun to watch.",saw regals dx experience make movie better made memorable rideit feels like ive seen dragon ball long know characters new movie enemies cant recall became alliesanyway first time im experiencing dragonball cgi blend thought really cool first dragonball watched goku main guy really interesting despite piccalo things seemed place cool see take lead onethese dragonball movies made quick fix episodic series opinion film actually good job capturing story development take episodes fight breaks outoverall lot fun watch
30,"This is a great dragon ball film. It's got substance and you truly don't know what's going to happen. For a dragon ball movie that's saying something, it's not supposed to have a big plot. Dragon Ball is power ups and energy blasts. This movie does WAY more than that. I'm not saying it had a deep story because it doesn't but it's not stupid and it kept my interest. One of the best dragon ball movies I've ever seen. I'd give it 10/10 if the story was more complex. But it set the future of dragon ball up so well, I'm so excited.",great dragon ball film got substance truly dont know whats going happen dragon ball movie thats saying something supposed big plot dragon ball power ups energy blasts movie way im saying deep story doesnt stupid kept interest one best dragon ball movies ive ever seen id give story complex set future dragon ball well im excited

The fight scenes were clear and you could follow everything that was happening which is something you don't normally see in the Dragon Ball franchise. The film made me laugh me throughout and not just because of the call backs or fan service. It was genuinely funny. The music elevated the scenes instead of just having some ""hype"" tracks randomly play.

33,"I am a huge DB fan. I have seen every episode of DB, DBZ, Super every movie and DBZA on top of that. I was hesitant going into this movie. From the trailers, the animation style was very off-putting for me. Disney stops doing 2D animation, then Studio Ghibli and now even Toei has succumbed to 3D computer animation. The new style certainly took some getting used to, but save for a few shaky parts, it didn't get in the way of an excellent story.The movie goes at much slower pace compared to some of the more action heavy DBZ movies. The first ~10 minutes is a lot of set up for the villainous force. Thankfully they know how to keep the exposition interesting through quirky characters, fun dialogue and some background gags.As a huge fan of the series, the story delivered on just about everything I wanted in a Dragonball movie. There were several scenes that felt like were a love letter to the longtime fans of show. They do this, not in a forced pandering way, but in a natural character driven manner. For those who think the series was losing steam and relying too heavily nostalgia this uses old tropes in a new way.The new characters they introduce are a ton of fun, and the returning characters are pitch perfect the way they should be. I give a kudos that this movie gives some characters other than Goku and Vegeta some much needed time to shine. There are two scenes towards the end that are some top-tier Dragon Ball stuff, I was cheering in the theatre.It may not have had everything I wished for, but Shenron was still able to give me a 7-Star ball.",huge db fan seen every episode db dbz super every movie dbza top hesitant going movie trailers animation style offputting disney stops animation studio ghibli even toei succumbed computer animation new style certainly took getting used save shaky parts didnt get way excellent storythe movie goes much slower pace compared action heavy dbz movies first minutes lot set villainous force thankfully know keep exposition interesting quirky characters fun dialogue background gagsas huge fan series story delivered everything wanted dragonball movie several scenes felt like love letter longtime fans show forced pandering way natural character driven manner think series losing steam relying heavily nostalgia uses old tropes new waythe new characters introduce ton fun returning characters pitch perfect way give kudos movie gives characters goku vegeta much needed time shine two scenes towards end toptier dragon ball stuff cheering theatreit may everything wished shenron still able give star ball
34,"Unpopular opinion: This is the best Dragon Ball Super movie, and is better than the previous film.Sure, the animation is not as impressive as in the Neo Broly movie, but plot-wise, is way more enjoyable, since it allowed the rest of the cast to do something, instead of focusing only in Goku and Vegeta (And their new best pal, the genocidal cat god)Gohan and Piccolo are finally allowed to do something.Pan is allowed to do something.Goten and Trunks are finally allowed to grow up (Even if they are reduced to comic-relief roles)Zero ""Joker"" Frieza-worship here. (So glad he did not appear here, and I hope the next time he appears he is killed off for good)Peter Griffin ""Not a hero"" Goku continues to be an idiot, but at least, his screen-time is reduced to a much more bearable point.

37,"I feel like people have been wanting Piccolo, and especially gohan to get the spotlight because they were extremely minor characters in the majority of DBS, so to see them getting attention from the writers is enough for me. The plot is more far fetched than most Dragon Ball storylines, so it may seem odd, but its still engaging. Gohan and Piccolo's forms makes me very hopeful for the DBS continuation in the future. I was well aware that Goku and Vegeta were barely going to be in the film, and it was not a shock. They treated Cell more like a final boss, and it worked in a way, however he should have been given lines, because he felt sort of lifeless in tense moments.",feel like people wanting piccolo especially gohan get spotlight extremely minor characters majority dbs see getting attention writers enough plot far fetched dragon ball storylines may seem odd still engaging gohan piccolos forms makes hopeful dbs continuation future well aware goku vegeta barely going film shock treated cell like final boss worked way however given lines felt sort lifeless tense moments
38,"Dragon Ball through its films has always been characterized by seeking new animation techniques to keep up with its contemporary animations. This new movie has been no exception. Using its successful video games as a source and inspiration, its producers wanted to adopt an aesthetic much closer to 3D figures, but unfortunately, for the most purist fans, among whom I consider myself, it wasn't a very successful decision. This effect is well applied for the different settings, buildings and means of transportation shown in the film, but not for the visual development of the characters, because they all look very far from their best version exhibited in the distant Dragon Ball Z.Regarding the story, the essence of the anime is still intact. Overall, it's a pretty entertaining movie. There's a lot of action, there's a good dose of humor, there are a couple of good nods to the old canon and also a small amount of emotion that serves as motivation for certain moments. Gohan's new transformation disappointed me in many ways, but I liked Piccolo's transformation. The villain on duty isn't original at all, because in addition to having the appearance of an old character, he also has similarities to an old Spin Off related to Broly.I hope that for future movies they know how to listen to criticism, as they did at the beginning of the Dragon Ball Super series.",dragon ball films always characterized seeking new animation techniques keep contemporary animations new movie exception using successful video games source inspiration producers wanted adopt aesthetic much closer figures unfortunately purist fans among consider wasnt successful decision effect well applied different settings buildings means transportation shown film visual development characters look far best version exhibited distant dragon ball zregarding story essence anime still intact overall pretty entertaining movie theres lot action theres good dose humor couple good nods old canon also small amount emotion serves motivation certain moments gohans new transformation disappointed many ways liked piccolos transformation villain duty isnt original addition appearance old character also similarities old spin related brolyi hope future movies know listen criticism beginning dragon ball super series

44,"It's always nice to see DBZ on a big screen. This would've been better as a extension to the never-ending Dragonball Super series instead of an actual movie. The visuals were Flawless. Introducing an older Pan was the best idea because she easily stole the show with every scene. The Plot unfortunately was very lackluster. It felt very forced and was written to force a situation that did not live up to its potential. The plan was to get Gohan back to his ""Cell Saga"" form. Even went as far as introducing ""Cell-Max"" as a villain. Cell Max had ZERO to do with Original Cell other than visual similarities. No backstory..no emotional ties to the story. The hype around this movie was Gohan's new transformation which maybe lasted around 5 minutes of screen time. There was no big fight between him and Cell Max to lead to the final blow. Just a transformation, Cell getting restrained and the final blow. The extra characters joining the fight made it a bit entertaining but it still fell short in my eyes. I'm not mad at the characters introduced at all. They are perfect for the series but deserved their own spotlight vs trying to fit with the initial plan.",always nice see dbz big screen wouldve better extension neverending dragonball super series instead actual movie visuals flawless introducing older pan best idea easily stole show every scene plot unfortunately lackluster felt forced written force situation live potential plan get gohan back cell saga form even went far introducing cellmax villain cell max zero original cell visual similarities backstoryno emotional ties story hype around movie gohans new transformation maybe lasted around minutes screen time big fight cell max lead final blow transformation cell getting restrained final blow extra characters joining fight made bit entertaining still fell short eyes im mad characters introduced perfect series deserved spotlight vs trying fit initial plan

46,"Dragon Ball Super: Superhero is the latest Dragon Ball movie, but it's special for me as it's the first DB movie I've seen in theaters. It's actually the first anime movie I've seen in theaters in a VERY long time. I live in a small town, and there are no theaters that close to me that play anime films that are released in the states. So, I've missed out on seeing many big anime films on the big screen, including the last several Dragon Ball films. I was going to see this film eventually regardless, because the Dragon Ball franchise, mainly DBZ, is one of those series that defined my childhood. It was my gateway into anime. I watched Dragon Ball Z every day on Toonami back in the day. I watched all the old DBZ movies, and played many of the video games, most notably the Budokai series.Watching this movie on the big screen definitely took me back to those times, as there are many callbacks to DBZ, Dragon Ball, and even the video games. It feels a lot like a love letter to the franchise and fans (unless you're fans of Gotenks). Also, this review will have some minor spoilers regarding what happens.Having said all that, I'm not one of those blinded my nostalgia. I acknowledge that the series is far from perfect. Looking back most of the old movies are pretty subpar if not just bad. The last arc of DBZ, the Buu Saga, was not that great. In my opinion, nearly everything the franchise has done since the end of Z has dropped the ball. Most fans will agree that GT wasn't that good. It's pretty much a universal opinion that DB Evolution was horrible. And this new Super relaunch of the past decade has largely been disappointing for me. Granted, I do like Battle of Gods and he previous movie, Broly. However, I'm not a fan of Resurrection F or the Super anime series. I can go on for pages stating why I don't like them. With that, and the early trailers showcasing that this would be 3D animated movie, my expectation for this movie were pretty low.However, I can say I was surprised by this. Now, that are some things that irked me in the film (things that have been issues for a long time) but I had a much better time with it than I expected. Much of that has to do with the fact that this is not a story centering on Goku and Vegeta for once. That's been an ongoing problem with the franchise for the longest time.This time Piccolo and Gohan have center stage. I've always been a fan of both characters, but the franchise has not properly utilized them since the Cell Saga of DBZ. Rarely enough, you can say Piccolo is the main protagonist of this film. That's something I never thought I'd see. On the antagonist side, I do like the Gamma Twins (Gamma #1 & Gamma #2). When I saw the trailer, I wasn't sure about them, but they might be my favorite characters of the movie.The action is also pretty fun. It's not on the level of Broly, but it's still highly entertaining, which is what most people watch a Dragon Ball movie for. I actually didn't mind the CG in this. I definitely like 2D animation more (and some CG anime are really bad), but there some 3D anime that I really enjoy. Heck, I'm a regular follower of RWBY, so I'm used to 3D animation. While a bit dodgy to start with, the animation was well done for the most part. Would I like the movie better if it was 2D animation? Probably. While the movie is mostly CG there are some segments of 2D animation, and it looks great. Part of me wished for the whole movie to be in that animation. Still, the CG is my no means the worst.Now, we get to my negatives. The biggest one is Cell Max. First of all, his deign is crap. They just took Cell's second form (his worst one btw) and gave it a red recoloring. Wow. It must have taken a whole 2 minutes for the creators to come up with that design. I had the same issue with Frieza in Resurrection F. They took Frieza's third form and gave it a gold paintjob. Here it's actually a bit worse because it's not even the original Cell. It's a mindless creature with Cell's design presumably just for fanservice. If you're not even going to have the Cell we know then they should've just designed an original creature, but that wouldn't be as marketable.The heroes' new forms fare better, but only slightly. I'm not a big fan of Gohan's new form, to be honest. I didn't mind Piccolo's, though the name sucks. But at least there was a bit of effort put into his design. That's been a consistent problem in Super. Except for maybe Ultra Instinct, the new transformations, for both the heroes and villains, have been pretty lame. Most are simple recolors. There's a distinct lack of imagination with these forms likes there was in DBZ or even GT. As bad a GT could get, at least it had cool characters designs. It had cool original villains with intimidating designs like Baby. Super Saiyan 4 had a very different and unique look to it rather than just being a simple recolor like SS Blue or SS Rose. It's just laziness.Speaking of which, while it's cool to see teen Goten and Trunks I wish they had more to do. As usual, they had to be lazy with Goten's look. First, he looked just like Kid Goku, and here he looks almost identical to Cell Saga Gohan. Even his end of Z look reminds me of Yamcha in OG Dragon Ball. Why is GT the only place where he has an original design? Also, if you were looking forward to seeing Teen Gotenks in this film, you're in for disappointment. Toei seems to love trolling us with Teen Gotenks. First, they did it in GT when they were going to fuse, but then Goku was like, ""No, you can't do that."" Here they fuse, but screw it up so it's just fat Gotenks, and he's played for laughs. It just shows that Toei really doesn't like Goten, Trunks, or Gotenks for whatever reason.Regardless of that, if you're at all a fan of Dragon Ball, I think this movie will at least entertain you, especially if you like Gohan and Piccolo like I do. It doesn't disappoint of the action, and the animation won't bother once you get used to it. When it comes to the new Dragon Ball movies, I'd say this is definitely better than Resurrection F.

47,It was truly refreshing to see where Goku or Vegeta didn't land the final blow. Nice homage to Cell vs Gohan fight in DBZ. Not over the top comedic. Liked everything about the movie.,truly refreshing see goku vegeta didnt land final blow nice homage cell vs gohan fight dbz top comedic liked everything movie
48,"Yes, I do mean it. The development of the new characters along with the emotion at the end of the movie, gave this more of a cinematic feel than any other previous Dragon Ball movie including Broly. Pan and Piccolo steal the show, and do a stellar job carrying the plot. Anyone who is a fan of the series will be treated with some of the best moments in the entire franchise... The animation was phenomenal. It is the best use of 3d in anime I've ever scene. They found a way to blend old style character designs with the new 3d style. The dark outlines and facial expression, gave it an OG Dragon Ball look. Additionally, there are several shots of RR aircrafts and robots that will have you feeling nostalgic.... My final note is this, if you read any review with a low score that starts out talking about the 3d style looking bad, they went into the movie with a closed mind, or have not seen the final product. Many prominent members of the community have given this movie's animation a 9/10 or higher.",yes mean development new characters along emotion end movie gave cinematic feel previous dragon ball movie including broly pan piccolo steal show stellar job carrying plot anyone fan series treated best moments entire franchise animation phenomenal best use anime ive ever scene found way blend old style character designs new style dark outlines facial expression gave og dragon ball look additionally several shots rr aircrafts robots feeling nostalgic final note read review low score starts talking style looking bad went movie closed mind seen final product many prominent members community given movies animation higher
49,"The only think it has going for it is the animation and seeing well known characters. Although the most popular characters only make a short appearance, because they're too busy training in Beerus world.The movie is full of inconsistencies, like Pan learning to fly with Piccolo when she could already do it as a baby. Or Vegeta training through meditation like Goku is very well known for, but you see Goku say that is not even a training method.The movie has the typical lines that make Gohan fans giggle, like Piccolo saying that Gohan is the Saiyan with the most potential of them all. When following Toriyama explanation for Gohan potential, then Trunks, Goten, Pan and Bulla all have more potential than him.Does Gohan even trains to gain the new transformation?! No. Like always he's been too busy not training and he just transforms because of Piccolo, because he only needs to get angrier. So the transformation, like the ultimate form it's an unearned form. Much like Piccolo gets two power boots because Dende upgrades the dragon so he can give those boosts in power.Even Cell Max is a complete disappointment, because at no time do you feel that he's a threat. Not when he completely out of control purposely fires Ki beams at the Earth, all hit the Earth and nothing happens. Zero damage to the planet. One of the beams falls right next to Bulma and she's fine without even a scratch. You can even say that feats wise Cell Max is weaker than Cell.The story is juvenile to say the least, and the fights aren't even impressive at all.This movie only has one reason of being. To give a cookie to Gohan fans and tell them Gohan is as powerful as Goku and Vegeta, even though the movie gives zero proof of that. The only thing it gives you is Piccolo and Gohan personal opinions, about how they think Gohan is now as powerful as Goku and Vegeta.And that in the end is no proof at all.At least Freeza when he defeats Gas and then defeats Goku and Vegeta in their Ultra forms, he actually does it. No one says he could possibly do it or that they think he could do it, you see Freeza do it in his Black Freeza form. And at least Frieza had to train for ten years to get the new form.The Manga did more for Freeza in one chapter than this entire movie does for Gohan.And that only shoes why this movie should've never been done. Compared to for example the Battle of Gods but especially the Broly movie, Super Hero isn't even worth the time watching it.",think going animation seeing well known characters although popular characters make short appearance theyre busy training beerus worldthe movie full inconsistencies like pan learning fly piccolo could already baby vegeta training meditation like goku well known see goku say even training methodthe movie typical lines make gohan fans giggle like piccolo saying gohan saiyan potential following toriyama explanation gohan potential trunks goten pan bulla potential himdoes gohan even trains gain new transformation like always hes busy training transforms piccolo needs get angrier transformation like ultimate form unearned form much like piccolo gets two power boots dende upgrades dragon give boosts powereven cell max complete disappointment time feel hes threat completely control purposely fires ki beams earth hit earth nothing happens zero damage planet one beams falls right next bulma shes fine without even scratch even say feats wise cell max weaker cellthe story juvenile say least fights arent even impressive allthis movie one reason give cookie gohan fans tell gohan powerful goku vegeta even though movie gives zero proof thing gives piccolo gohan personal opinions think gohan powerful goku vegetaand end proof allat least freeza defeats gas defeats goku vegeta ultra forms actually one says could possibly think could see freeza black freeza form least frieza train ten years get new formthe manga freeza one chapter entire movie gohanand shoes movie shouldve never done compared example battle gods especially broly movie super hero isnt even worth time watching

51,"Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, whilst having probably the worst name of any Dragon Ball movie, is one of the most enjoyable Dragon Ball films ever put to screen. It cannot be stressed enough to actually watch this film in a cinema or bare minimum an actual HD screening not a camrip like so many have and only have.This movie's animation is spectacular when it counts, the fights have a real 3D sense that Director Tetsurô Kodama takes full advantage of, giving Dragon Ball new life and originality, with previous attempts of Dragon Ball CGI not even coming close. Combined with this films booming soundtrack, the fight scenes leave a huge impact and are an absolute awe to watch.It is not entirely perfect, and rough around the edges when major spectacle isn't taking place (ironically it looked the worst at the start where you would want to make a good impression), but 95% of the time looks great and is getting too much unfair bandwagon hate over freeze framing transition shots.This films pacing is rocket fast never dragging, yet never feeling particularly rushed. This is impressive as this movie takes a step back from the nonstop action of Dragon Ball Super: Broly, and presents with some character moments and nonchalant comedy. The change of Piccolo to leading man with the dynamic between him and Gohan works well albeit, a little Déjà vu. The movie never feels like it is missing the presence of Goku and Vegeta, however of course, they are still coerced in here. Goku and Vegeta's scenes were not needed and are purely here as they are of course the most popular characters, but, their fight is a highlight and its thrilling spectacle distracts the viewer from its non-importance.Addressing common criticism of this film, some are fair whilst others feel very contradictory for Dragon Ball SUPER. The most common criticism I hear of this film is that it is pure nostalgia pandering and nothing more. There is definitely apparent nostalgia, but no worse is it than Dragon Ball Super BROLY, the movie that literally is about reusing a villain and was marketed around Gogeta fighting him. Regarding the final villain of this flick, he admittedly has little character and is a pure powerhouse, yet the same can pretty much be said for Broly, aside from a few lines and a pretty candid backstory, he is no different. Two wrongs dont make a right, and the Broly film was still great, but this movie is getting hate for something it equally stumbled on.The finale sequence (whilst spectacular in its grandeur) is absolute BS and not at all earned, and really feels like marketing ploys for Dokkan, figures etc. There are also a few too many retcons and ""bold"" statements (to say the least) that make up a major part of my negative criticism of this movie that if you know you know and/or will see, all feeling pointless and almost as if Toriyama is just trying to troll his audience.At my IMAX screening they were only showing the dub and whilst I will always prefer the traditional Japanese voice actors, everyone does a good job here, Sabat does a great job as leading man.Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero is one of the easiest movies you'll ever watch, due to its spectacular spectacle and style along with its non-stop pacing. It is flawed in some of its narrative with pointless retcons and questionable attempts at appealing to nostalgia, but regardless will have you engaged from start to finish never waning.

Son Goku & Vegeta can't help them coz out of communication. This flawlessly makes sense coz both of them could easily beat the enemy, LOL.The main pros are a well-narrated story and easy to understand. Gladfully, the quick intro really helps us to catch up with the story of Dragon Ball Z.

Japanese jokes & cultures, social construction & morals, stupidity & innocence are always part of the Anime Ambiance. This is hard to be missed by anime lovers.Lastly, I'd say it's a reasonable movie. Not too long, not too many jokes, not too hard to understand, and everything seems perfect. Especially, the story is reasonable, coz the main enemy makes Son Gohan and his friends struggle due to lack of training.Besides that, everything is just standard. Moral value, visual, and music is nothing special except my main motivation to lit my nostalgic memories.Nevertheless, this movie is fun, so nostalgic, and easy to catch up!

55,"This is a movie that I would say is too funny for its own good. Why is this? Because it's a story about world ending monsters and super powered aliens who can destroy planets built upon the foundations of a comedy movie. It never manages to find the right balance between these two tones, so when it's serious, it has no impact on me because instead of making me care, the movie has been making me laugh. When the movie is funny, it doesn't land because thirty seconds ago it was a serious action flick. It doesn't know what it wants to be, so it doesn't work. I still enjoyed it well enough, though. Despite its relatively low stakes, confused tone and incredibly poor pacing, it manages to stay entertaining throughout, propped up by its incredible action and decent humor.

People may not like it because they're use to the hand drawn animation from before, but this is a step forward. I definitely recommend a Dragonball fan to watch this as you'll either love it or like it, no on can hate this movie.

Piccolo definitely one of the main highlights of the film, especially his awesome new form. Wish the name was a bit more creative other than Orange Piccolo. Gohan is good as well, wish he needed a little more screen time. Love his form also by the way. And the Gammas were interesting antagonist of the film. My only issue was with the climax of how they decided to technically ""bring back cell"" by making him the new bio Broly. But hey I still like the design a lot better than Bio Broly by along shot. Also really love the animation at the beginning of rehashing the Dragonball history, kinda makes me want Toei to reanimated OG Dragonball, give them the same treatment as HxH, Jojo, and Full Metal.

61,"Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero (yes they are going with both supers) follows the path laid down by previous instalment Broly in making attempts to be an actual ""movie"".That is to say it goes in for some character development and world building. Its a while before we meet any of the regular characters with the first portion of the film focusing on a tiny mafioso type and his quiff sporting henchmen recruiting self professed ""super genius"" Dr Hedo to help rebuild the Red Ribbon Army. This establishes Super Hero's intent to deliver a story that old school fans can get behind without needing to be up to date with more recent events. The only real mention of last decades worth of TV show and movies being neatly contained in a side plot involving Goku, Vegeta and the newer characters.Dragon Ball is always a mix of the grandiose and ridiculous. Super Hero spends much more time focusing on the light hearted end of the scale, with Piccolo needing Gohan to step up after attempts to bring in Goku and Vegeta are thwarted by an ice cream tub and a plastic surgery addiction.This seems like the right way to go given the relatively low stakes, at least compared to the potentially universe ending events of the anime series.Whatever is going in Dragon Ball movie you know its really only passing time until a final fight. The big showdown here is fine, although the re imagining of a classic villain as a big roaring monster will divide fans, as will the mega clean 3D art style.New look not withstanding its a Dragon Ball movie and most people already know whether or not its for them.7 Super Saiyans out of 10 biological researchers.",dragon ball super super hero yes going supers follows path laid previous instalment broly making attempts actual moviethat say goes character development world building meet regular characters first portion film focusing tiny mafioso type quiff sporting henchmen recruiting self professed super genius dr hedo help rebuild red ribbon army establishes super heros intent deliver story old school fans get behind without needing date recent events real mention last decades worth tv show movies neatly contained side plot involving goku vegeta newer charactersdragon ball always mix grandiose ridiculous super hero spends much time focusing light hearted end scale piccolo needing gohan step attempts bring goku vegeta thwarted ice cream tub plastic surgery addictionthis seems like right way go given relatively low stakes least compared potentially universe ending events anime serieswhatever going dragon ball movie know really passing time final fight big showdown fine although imagining classic villain big roaring monster divide fans mega clean art stylenew look withstanding dragon ball movie people already know whether super saiyans biological researchers

63,"This was the first Anime Film I saw in theaters so this was new im used to streaming these sorts of things on the television or through my game console so seeing an anime like this was pretty neat to me. Anyway on with the review.This is the first Dragon Ball film to be entirely animated in 3D and so as someone who has watched all the shows and films this is a little distracting to start with, eventually, I got over it but still would have preferred the traditional 2D art style the series is known for.This film demonstrates that Dragon Ball could use more of their forgotten side characters than constantly relying on Goku or Vegeta all the time.The film mainly centers around Piccolo infiltrating the Red ribbon Army ( Yes they are back again) trying to figure out what nefarious schemes they are cooking up. They have created two new Androids GAMA 1 and 2 who are just as powerful as all of the Z Warriors combined and are instructed to wipe out the warriors after their creator was deceived into thinking that the show's heroes are the villains. Piccolo tries to enlist Gohans help but finds that he would be no help because Gohan has neglected his training, focusing on his career and family. So Piccolo infiltrates the Army to figure out their plans and stop them.This film is made for fans of Dragon Ball so newcomers are warned this film is not a friendly jumping-on point. There is a brief recap of the entire history of the show but it's very cramped and will be a lot for newcomers to take in without prior knowledge of the shows or films they reference in the movie.If you are a fan of Dragon Ball I think you will have a good time. The film calls back to a lot of the original dragon ball elements being more laid back and low stakes, I also liked that a lot of old characters got included in the film making for great nostalgic callbacks.This film made me smile because of the laid-back nature of Film and as such I did chuckle at a lot of the humor in the film. Dragon Ball is Known for its humor and I'm glad to see it intact here with characters that we have been disconnected from for so long because of how long the franchise has been going onAll in All, I had a really good time with this film, It's not my favorite out of the films ( Personally it's Battle Of Gods for me) and I would recommend this film to FANS and not New Comers if you are interested in watching but have not seen a lot of Dragon Ball then this film is not for you catch up first and then you can watch it with more clarity.",first anime film saw theaters new im used streaming sorts things television game console seeing anime like pretty neat anyway reviewthis first dragon ball film entirely animated someone watched shows films little distracting start eventually got still would preferred traditional art style series known forthis film demonstrates dragon ball could use forgotten side characters constantly relying goku vegeta timethe film mainly centers around piccolo infiltrating red ribbon army yes back trying figure nefarious schemes cooking created two new androids gama powerful z warriors combined instructed wipe warriors creator deceived thinking shows heroes villains piccolo tries enlist gohans help finds would help gohan neglected training focusing career family piccolo infiltrates army figure plans stop themthis film made fans dragon ball newcomers warned film friendly jumpingon point brief recap entire history show cramped lot newcomers take without prior knowledge shows films reference movieif fan dragon ball think good time film calls back lot original dragon ball elements laid back low stakes also liked lot old characters got included film making great nostalgic callbacksthis film made smile laidback nature film chuckle lot humor film dragon ball known humor im glad see intact characters disconnected long long franchise going onall really good time film favorite films personally battle gods would recommend film fans new comers interested watching seen lot dragon ball film catch first watch clarity
64,"The movie started well. I'm not one of the those fans that misses the inclusion of all the less relevant Z fighters like Gohan, Piccolo, etc. I still found myself enjoying how much of Piccolo we got in this one.On the other hand, the movie lacked originality and honestly, the impact that comes with 2D animation.Couldn't Pan already fly as a baby in some episodes of DBS??These power comparisons like ""Oh... they're on Goku and Vegeta's level"" or ""Even GOku and Vegeta wouldnt be able to defeat them"" throughout the movie, even tho they are designed to give a scale and give sense of danger, just make the movie less believable and in bad taste, because then we see Piccolo and Gohan dominate them. Feels like it diminuishes everything the DB verse has been building.Once again, they burped transformations in our faces without any context, build-up, hints, character merit or even just a name. I enjoyed DBS: Broly a lot and I enjoyed Ultra Instinct's inclusion in DBS but its getting ridiculous. If that is how they'll handle the franchise from now on, I dont think I can keep following.Gohan's new form looks ridiculously lame, out of a fan page for Super Sayian 20's concept. I was all up for a Piccolo upgrade but also... not like this. A wish and a ""bonus""??? With so much possibility of creating new Namekian lore to justify a new form, all this movie accomplished just feels lazy.Also, I can't be the only one that feels gohan doesn't deserve protagonism, he is quite boring and everything always comes so easy to him....Overall, it hurt to watch the last half hour.

66,"I enjoyed this film a lot! As a lifelong Dragon Ball fan and huge fan of Gohan growing up, it's great to see him back in action after he was more passive and not nearly as important in the narrative post cell games. Plus the characterization of him and Piccolo was on point and so much fun to see. Piccolo taking care of Pan as favors for Gohan and Videl was adorable to see, and the humor in this movie was great. The action as well was very well done, although at times admittedly the full 3D graphics of the movie got a little bit wonky to watch, but generally it was just fine.The premise was pretty decent as well. I was worried when I heard the movie was going to bring back the Red Ribbon Army, but I thought that they pulled it off in a believable and interesting way. The new characters were good and Hedo's motivations were a great change of pace.However, admittedly I'm not a huge fan of Gohan and Piccolo just getting ""new forms"" that don't have any substance to them in the long run, even though the Beast Form and Orange Form looked great. It felt a little bit forced, and the final villain just being an overgrown and mindless clone of Cell felt a little bland compared to the way they set up Hedo and the Gammas.Overall, a good and enjoyable watch, especially if you're a big Dragon Ball fan, but it's not any kind of masterpiece work of art.

71,"Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero continues from the last installment and continues to offer fans exactly what they come for with the property - energetic action, high stakes drama, quirky humor, and a sense of verisimilitude throughout, and as an added bonus new transformations, new characters, and a new style of animation.Akira Toriyama is like the Japanese equivalent to Todd McFarlane and Robert Leifeld - his story and characters are not the most original or well-written compared to his contemporaries, and his artwork can be inconsistent in terms of scale and presentation of character model, but nonetheless his stories are epic, his characters and artwork dynamic, and, above all else, is fun to be immersed in. This is especially true in regard to Dragon Ball as a franchise.I have to say that this new style of animation works extremely well for the property, I was skeptical at first but adjusted to it fairly quickly. This may in fact be the best animated Dragon Ball feature to date as every character is consistent in model, and the voice acting perfectly compliments the actions of the characters.This is pretty good for a fan of the property, one who is not very well-versed into Dragon Ball is likely going to be confused by a few things, especially if they have not seen the previous feature.",dragon ball super super hero continues last installment continues offer fans exactly come property energetic action high stakes drama quirky humor sense verisimilitude throughout added bonus new transformations new characters new style animationakira toriyama like japanese equivalent todd mcfarlane robert leifeld story characters original wellwritten compared contemporaries artwork inconsistent terms scale presentation character model nonetheless stories epic characters artwork dynamic else fun immersed especially true regard dragon ball franchisei say new style animation works extremely well property skeptical first adjusted fairly quickly may fact best animated dragon ball feature date every character consistent model voice acting perfectly compliments actions charactersthis pretty good fan property one wellversed dragon ball likely going confused things especially seen previous feature

79,"This movie's story actually had a reason to exist, unlike past DBZ movies where they just make an excuse for a villain to come out of nowhere and fight Goku and co. This story is unique because they brought back stuff from the past and made it work in the present.I did think the final villain was pretty lame as he had no dialogue and a very lazy way of defeating him. The animation was also questionable at moments. This 2D/3D hybrid works better than most others who have used it (looking at you Berserk), but it is not on par with the OG DBZ or Super. There is no substitute for classic 2D animation.All in all, the action was good and this was a worthy entry into the DBZ movies.6.8/10.",movies story actually reason exist unlike past dbz movies make excuse villain come nowhere fight goku co story unique brought back stuff past made work presenti think final villain pretty lame dialogue lazy way defeating animation also questionable moments dd hybrid works better others used looking berserk par og dbz super substitute classic animationall action good worthy entry dbz movies

83,"I really enjoyed this film for its great action and characters (the Gamma Brothers specifically are so fun to watch). And it was really nice to have the supporting cast take center stage and make Pan good for once rather than be all about Goku and Vegeta again. But the story felt like it was dialogue dumping to give us the information needed to get to the fighting. And while many aspects of the story are good, they mostly are just hollow retreads of older Dragon Ball. Want the Red Ribbon Army to return again with even more powerful androids? There you go. Want Gohan to stop training again to obtain an arbitrary power boost? Boom. Want some more forms that come out of nowhere with no build up or even feel like they're earned? SHAZAM! It seems they could've done so much more for the future of Dragon Ball for these characters, but they instead just went with what they knew worked and not what could've been new and interesting. It honestly just comes off as a hollow distraction that, while fun, does nothing but remind you of Dragon Ball's stagnation as a franchise.",really enjoyed film great action characters gamma brothers specifically fun watch really nice supporting cast take center stage make pan good rather goku vegeta story felt like dialogue dumping give us information needed get fighting many aspects story good mostly hollow retreads older dragon ball want red ribbon army return even powerful androids go want gohan stop training obtain arbitrary power boost boom want forms come nowhere build even feel like theyre earned shazam seems couldve done much future dragon ball characters instead went knew worked couldve new interesting honestly comes hollow distraction fun nothing remind dragon balls stagnation franchise

Seen a lot of reviewers hating on the new animation, granted it's not for everybody. But I was intrigued when the trailers came out, and I fully embraced the change in style here. Very cool to see Piccolo and Gohan get a main storyline for the 1st time in a long time, along with a badly needed power-up.

93,"As a lifetime fan of Dragonball, my opinion is that Dragonball Super has been a two man show for far too long. While the tournament of power saga brought some upgrades to the other classic Z fighters, it was merely served as a side dish, while continuing to paint Goku and Vegeta as the irreplacable saviors of their universe. This movie changes it, and I say it's a good thing. While not being nearly as good as the Broly movie, it's still a great spectacle in its own rights. I like how they explored the relationship between a master and a student (Piccolo -> Gohan), and used the feeling of nostalgia for the good ol' DBZ days. I enjoyed it quite much. I guess You could call it ""Fanservice - the movie"", but it's not necessarily a bad thing. It's good to bring back to life some great, but nowadays mostly unused characters. Especially such badasses. It's a long time coming for someone else to shine.The humor was pretty good, fight sequences looked quite awesome, although the new CGI style takes some getting used to. At the risk of not sounding original - I liked 2d better. The story was, your run of the mill revenge for destroying my fathers legacy/world domination plot, but as I wrote before, I loved the Piccolo -> Gohan (Master/Student) in this. Overall, while being predictable, the way the story enfolds was enjoyable.SPOILER WARNING!It's a shame though, what they did to my boy Cell. He was a great villain once, and here he's just feral.

94,"Dragon Ball Super: Superhero is fantastically balanced in its comedy and action pieces.Firstly, the film is captained by Piccolo, which is a fantastic departure from the Goku heavy norm. Piccolo is often the straight-man to everyone else's antics, making him very likable in the position. Piccolo's key relationship with Gohan is a reliable narrative to long time fans, and by proxy we get insight in Piccolo's relationship with Pan as a proxy parent (Goku and Gohan aren't so different). Other familiar characters come and go without dragging on the plot. I also really enjoyed the characters of Gamma 1 and Gamma 2, and their interactions.I'd say the weakest bit of the film is with the setup. I'm not particularly against relying on a classic foe, but a lot of the antagonists moves are expanded on extremely heavily and probably could've been revealed in a different sequence without bouncing the pace. I do think that the final opponent is fairly ""meh"" being a half-baked repeat.Being entirely 3D, it holds itself up fairly well. I think avoiding bouncing from 2D/Partial 3D and just maintaining 3D lets Dragon Ball pop out in a way it hasn't before.",dragon ball super superhero fantastically balanced comedy action piecesfirstly film captained piccolo fantastic departure goku heavy norm piccolo often straightman everyone elses antics making likable position piccolos key relationship gohan reliable narrative long time fans proxy get insight piccolos relationship pan proxy parent goku gohan arent different familiar characters come go without dragging plot also really enjoyed characters gamma gamma interactionsid say weakest bit film setup im particularly relying classic foe lot antagonists moves expanded extremely heavily probably couldve revealed different sequence without bouncing pace think final opponent fairly meh halfbaked repeatbeing entirely holds fairly well think avoiding bouncing dpartial maintaining lets dragon ball pop way hasnt

96,"After the success of DBS BROLY, my expectations for this movie was much higher. Unfortunately the result was far inferior.This movie is clearly an experiment to bring Dragon Ball to the 3D realm and while it is not as bad as many other projects from TOEI Animation, it is still bland and uncreative. The fight scenes do not even come close to the impact felt from the battles in DBS Broly from masterful animators like Yuya Takahashi, Naotoshi Shida and Chikashi Kubota. This aspect is fully felt in the final act when even the biggest hits from one of the main villains feel weightless without any impact frames.The best part of DBS Super hero comes from their slice of life moments, Pan's interactions with Piccolo and them just navigating everyday life. Those moments had me more interested than the actual fights which were void of tension and build up. Also, Gohan fans will get a little bit of satisfaction from this temporary boost he gets, though I doubt it will amount to anything relevant in the series.Not to mention every Dragon Ball fan knew where things were headed since the story is basically a retelling of the Cell Arc. It sounds mean to say but in a way the inferior box office earning of this movie compared to DBS BROLY might act as a lesson for TOEI Animation to not go into this direction ever again.It is a slightly above average film that is only garnering the attention it is due to the value of the franchise. Dragon Ball deserves far better than this.

97,"The movie decent. The parts with Pan and Piccolo were fun and the animation was good for what it is.In general the movie struggled with making the stakes feel real. There's never a point in time when the characters actually felt at all concerned about what might happen. Also, they mention making lots of Androids and just never do?? It never comes up again, they put the gun in and never fired that one.The other big issue is that there was 0 lead up for Gohan getting a new form. Tbh the way they did that felt like a dollar store knock off of the original SS2 transformation.The 2 main Androids were decent. They were fun and I enjoyed the time spent with them. But they never felt like real threats.Cell Max was the worst. Cell was amazing in Z. He was this threatening, creepy force up until his perfect form. Then he was this almost charismatic and menacing murder machine. It was great. Then we get Cell Max. The worst of the forms, but big and red and MINDLESS. None of the sheer menace that Cell had in Z.Everything on Beerus' planet felt weird as hell and took up a bunch of screen time just to give us a good fight and some weird comedy moments to explain why they were unavailable.Ultimately, fine movie probably won't ever watch it again but didn't outright hate it.",movie decent parts pan piccolo fun animation good isin general movie struggled making stakes feel real theres never point time characters actually felt concerned might happen also mention making lots androids never never comes put gun never fired onethe big issue lead gohan getting new form tbh way felt like dollar store knock original ss transformationthe main androids decent fun enjoyed time spent never felt like real threatscell max worst cell amazing z threatening creepy force perfect form almost charismatic menacing murder machine great get cell max worst forms big red mindless none sheer menace cell zeverything beerus planet felt weird hell took bunch screen time give us good fight weird comedy moments explain unavailableultimately fine movie probably wont ever watch didnt outright hate

100,"To be clear I am not a diehard Anime fan, nor am I familiar with the DragonBall series. This was an exciting action cartoon geared at twenty-somethings. I liked the action and the characters. It was very funny at times. The animation was simple, but good. It was visually interesting throughout. My son is a Dragonball fan and he loved this movie. The fight choreography was pretty sophisticated for an animated film and I really did admire that.

106,"Aside from DB Evolution, this has got to be the worst DB movie ever. The animation mixed with 3D looks cheap and poorly made. There is no story! This is like a DB Heroes 8 min episode turned into a movie. Made just about the cheap transformations. I'm so sad this movie happened because DB is my favorite anime. I grew up with it. Most DB movies/shows have at least some sort of humor to it and make you laugh. This one does not. It's just bad and makes no sense. Pretty sure is just for kids and this younger generation who consumes just about anything.Overall I give this a rating of the worst DB movie ever and whomever okay'd this should be ashamed of themselves.",aside db evolution got worst db movie ever animation mixed looks cheap poorly made story like db heroes min episode turned movie made cheap transformations im sad movie happened db favorite anime grew db moviesshows least sort humor make laugh one bad makes sense pretty sure kids younger generation consumes anythingoverall give rating worst db movie ever whomever okayd ashamed

108,"Somehow every time they make a new Dragon Ball movie, it's better than the last one. That didn't used to be the case. A lot of those old Dragon Ball movies basically exist as cheap ways to remix the current story arc. Instead of fighting Frieza, Goku has to fight his BROTHER, Cooler! Totally different! And worse, somehow.These new movies seem to be doing the most interesting stuff with the Dragon Ball franchise, raising questions and poking at old lore in ways that really stoke the fires in an older fan like me. Hero is pretty up front in asking the question: ""Do we really need Goku to do this stuff?""And, well, the answer is no. We don't. Everybody else is capable enough without Goku having to be the one to do all the work. The movie establishes early on that Goku and Vegeta are somewhere else and can't be contacted, so the rest of the story is about the second-stringers figuring out what to do when their ""win button"" isn't available anymore. It's legitimately great.The animation is spectacular. I've never been a fan of cel-shaded CG before, but it looks absolutely gorgeous here. I think it's because they also mix in traditional animation with it, so you can't always tell what's the CG and what's hand-animated. But it all has so much detail, and so many little flourishes, like the way hair bounces or clothing flows as characters move. It's next level stuff.And the writing is, as always, pretty spot-on. These characters really drive home the vibe of all being old friends, with effortlessly natural performances and genuinely funny dialog. It's always wild to think of those early Funimation dubs on TV and how far we've come since those days.I just wish the actual story itself was a little stronger. The whole framework of this movie is reminding us that Gohan and Piccolo are still cool. While we get a lot of time to see Piccolo develop, I would have liked to see Gohan take more time transitioning from bookworm back to one of the strongest fighters on earth.But don't let that detract too much from how cool this movie is. It's Dragon Ball, and at its heart, Dragon Ball has always been about coming up with an excuse to have characters fight. Compared to the limp fights in Battle of Gods and the hyperactive incoherency of Broly, Hero's fights are big, impactful, and easy to follow. More importantly, they come down to more than just ""do the kamehameha again, but stronger this time.""I wish the rest of the Dragon Ball franchise was this bold, interesting, and compact about its story arcs. Every time we get one of these new movies I feel like they go out of their way to show me a new side of these characters,and that's what really matters more than anything. Hero hits almost (but not quite) every bullseye you could ask for.",somehow every time make new dragon ball movie better last one didnt used case lot old dragon ball movies basically exist cheap ways remix current story arc instead fighting frieza goku fight brother cooler totally different worse somehowthese new movies seem interesting stuff dragon ball franchise raising questions poking old lore ways really stoke fires older fan like hero pretty front asking question really need goku stuffand well answer dont everybody else capable enough without goku one work movie establishes early goku vegeta somewhere else cant contacted rest story secondstringers figuring win button isnt available anymore legitimately greatthe animation spectacular ive never fan celshaded cg looks absolutely gorgeous think also mix traditional animation cant always tell whats cg whats handanimated much detail many little flourishes like way hair bounces clothing flows characters move next level stuffand writing always pretty spoton characters really drive home vibe old friends effortlessly natural performances genuinely funny dialog always wild think early funimation dubs tv far weve come since daysi wish actual story little stronger whole framework movie reminding us gohan piccolo still cool get lot time see piccolo develop would liked see gohan take time transitioning bookworm back one strongest fighters earthbut dont let detract much cool movie dragon ball heart dragon ball always coming excuse characters fight compared limp fights battle gods hyperactive incoherency broly heros fights big impactful easy follow importantly come kamehameha stronger timei wish rest dragon ball franchise bold interesting compact story arcs every time get one new movies feel like go way show new side charactersand thats really matters anything hero hits almost quite every bullseye could ask
109,"By now, as used to as we are as things like the constant transformations in the series, or characters like Vegeta, Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Beerus, Whis, Mr. Satan, Videl, Pan, etc. Let's not forget where the whole series started? Before DragonBall Z, DragonBall G. T. And DragonBall Super, there was just DragonBall. The beginning of the storyline to this series did not start with the arrival of Raditz. Before all this, there were 153 episodes of DragonBall. The characters I mentioned above were not in the series, however we get to know most of the other characters we know through the rest of the series, along with characters we stop seeing, like Launch in DragonBall. I'm sure most of us would want to see Launch again, even for a cameo. DragonBall was not about Saiyans and Super Saiyan Transformations, along with Goku and Piccolo's planets they originated from Vegeta and Namek. Some of us even prefer DragonBall to DragonBall Z. But, most of us that have watched the series whatever our favorite, could at least point out things DragonBall did better than the other series? We know the Red Ribbon Army not long after DragonBall starts, but not Dr. Gero instead Dr. Flappe. The RR Army was a very interesting organization For Real! There are even a couple of RR Army Songs. That saga was interesting, and there's interesting storylines including in the General Blue Saga. General Blue who is a member of the RR Army, there's a storyline of finding a hidden Pirate Cave with Pirate Treasure. That's a storyline we're not used to seeing in the DragonBall series, and to me conveys a strong storyline, besides knowing the whole series for battle. We also know Piccolo in DragonBall even before Vegeta, and while Piccolo is mostly seen as a good guy from DragonBall Z and a mentor now, it makes him more interesting how he started evil, and his fight was incredible. Anyway, why am I saying this? A line Piccolo says in the movie is something, like ""Do Your Research."" While people that have seen the series notice plot holes and things that seem forgotten, this movie took us back to earlier things we remember from DragonBall and DragonBall Z. Piccolo is a character we like and a lot of us want to see him more in action. A lot of us feel like he's now underused. How this remembers things from earlier in the series, you even see Piccolo do a move you only really see him use once in DragonBall and maybe one of the other movies. You're surprised to not see him use it after DragonBall, but I won't say what the move is? Piccolo also seems to be the Piccolo we remember and like! Gohan gets time to shine too. If you saw the trailer, you might have noticed there's spotlight on Piccolo and Gohan, when a lot of us feel like there's too much spotlight on Goku and Vegeta. Though, now Gohan seems like a nerd. In the movie, he reminded me of Stu Pickles from Rugrats, even a somewhat similar hairstyle. It's still cool to see him in action! The movie was entertaining, and it's nice to hear about the RR Army again. But, none of us would think Cell Max is better than Cell from D. B. Z. Also, Broly in Dragon Ball Super, now voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch, that played Adam the Black Ranger in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers after Zack. Broly looks better in the original D. B. Z. Movies than he does now. While there are some cool special effects, a lot of us prefer the original animation from the show. The movie was entertaining, but I didn't think it was quite as entertaining as a lot of DragonBall Z. The episodes I mentioned above, like the RR Army Pirate Treasure storyline, or fight with Piccolo in DragonBall might also seem more entertaining to you than movie. You get tired of some of these new things and transformations. I maybe should have talked more about the movie, but I'm saying a thing the movie did right was remind us of what happened earlier in the DragonBall series, where I can remind you where this whole series came from?",used things like constant transformations series characters like vegeta gohan goten trunks beerus whis mr satan videl pan etc lets forget whole series started dragonball z dragonball g dragonball super dragonball beginning storyline series start arrival raditz episodes dragonball characters mentioned series however get know characters know rest series along characters stop seeing like launch dragonball im sure us would want see launch even cameo dragonball saiyans super saiyan transformations along goku piccolos planets originated vegeta namek us even prefer dragonball dragonball z us watched series whatever favorite could least point things dragonball better series know red ribbon army long dragonball starts dr gero instead dr flappe rr army interesting organization real even couple rr army songs saga interesting theres interesting storylines including general blue saga general blue member rr army theres storyline finding hidden pirate cave pirate treasure thats storyline used seeing dragonball series conveys strong storyline besides knowing whole series battle also know piccolo dragonball even vegeta piccolo mostly seen good guy dragonball z mentor makes interesting started evil fight incredible anyway saying line piccolo says movie something like research people seen series notice plot holes things seem forgotten movie took us back earlier things remember dragonball dragonball z piccolo character like lot us want see action lot us feel like hes underused remembers things earlier series even see piccolo move really see use dragonball maybe one movies youre surprised see use dragonball wont say move piccolo also seems piccolo remember like gohan gets time shine saw trailer might noticed theres spotlight piccolo gohan lot us feel like theres much spotlight goku vegeta though gohan seems like nerd movie reminded stu pickles rugrats even somewhat similar hairstyle still cool see action movie entertaining nice hear rr army none us would think cell max better cell b z also broly dragon ball super voiced johnny yong bosch played adam black ranger mighty morphin power rangers zack broly looks better original b z movies cool special effects lot us prefer original animation show movie entertaining didnt think quite entertaining lot dragonball z episodes mentioned like rr army pirate treasure storyline fight piccolo dragonball might also seem entertaining movie get tired new things transformations maybe talked movie im saying thing movie right remind us happened earlier dragonball series remind whole series came
110,"I have never, ever thought I'd be giving any Dragon Ball work a bad review, yet here I am. Why, WHY!! This film had so much potential. Cool new android design with actual personalities. Then gave us boring fight scenes. The inconsistencies in animation. Piccolo's new and atypical personality actual grew on me but it just didn't feel like Piccolo. New transformations just didn't have the emotional impact of others because of the bland, pointless and rushed plot. The continued disrespect of Goten. It's time for Goten to shine! Gohans story has already been destroyed, nobody wanted this, it's too late. Grey hair for Gohan after Goku's Grey hair in UI just didn't sit right with me. There was a scene that came off as foreshadowing with Broly continually grimicing while watching Goku and Vegata train but that went nowhere. Then we have Cell... CELL??? COME ON!!

111,"Dragonball brought into the era of smartphones. The jokes come quicker, the characters are almost aware of the nonsensical elements of their universe. The main thrust of the story is Gohan reviving his fighting spirit so he can protect his loved ones. The movie tells this story well and despite my reservations found the CG to be pleasant to look at.Despite the spectacular fights this movie did something very disturbing with the characters, some of which fans have gotten to know and love over the last 30(!) years. The newer characters were not spared from this either. For the sake of comedy they have been reduced to their most annoying aspects: Bulma's vanity has turned into an addiction, Whis' aloofness has turned into reckless abandon, Beerus seemingly only cares about food and now - a romantic interest in a mortal (what the hell?).Even Gohan does not escape this flanderization. He actually says in response to Picollo telling him they must be ready for the next world-ending threat 'what's the chance of that happening?'. As if he has forgotten the last 3 crises, and how in each he had to re-learn the lesson of constant readiness.Ultimately the powerups at the end were not earned, but built on nostalgia and fan service. The movie was but if you really care about these characters and the journey they have been on, then you will feel like something was stolen from you and sold at the super saiyan garage sale.",dragonball brought era smartphones jokes come quicker characters almost aware nonsensical elements universe main thrust story gohan reviving fighting spirit protect loved ones movie tells story well despite reservations found cg pleasant look atdespite spectacular fights movie something disturbing characters fans gotten know love last years newer characters spared either sake comedy reduced annoying aspects bulmas vanity turned addiction whis aloofness turned reckless abandon beerus seemingly cares food romantic interest mortal helleven gohan escape flanderization actually says response picollo telling must ready next worldending threat whats chance happening forgotten last crises relearn lesson constant readinessultimately powerups end earned built nostalgia fan service movie really care characters journey feel like something stolen sold super saiyan garage sale

Now I'm waiting for DRAGON ball super new season. We should support anime movies to grow anime industry in India.This movie have a great story, good characters, best 3D animation and the most important thing put more focused on other members of Z-Fighters specially Piccolo (Toriyama's favourite character). Toriyama wanted to make Piccolo great again and also wanted to gave him a new form, in this movie he done it all and you all gonna like it. The best thing about this movie is that we don't have enough of Goku & Vegeta. We've seen enough of the greatest duo and we wanted to see others badly. This movie proved that DB seires has its existence even without Goku & Vegeta. Piccolo is main lead character also most focused character here. His relationship with Pan is nostalgic. He get the new form which known as ""Orange Piccolo"" and believe me it's one hell of a transformation. Gives same vibe as SuperSaiyan transformation. Movie have best humour, best music and best action.This movie introduced some new characters such as, Dr. Hedo (Grandson of Dr. Gero), Magento (President of New Red Ribbon Army), Gamma 1 & 2 (Two Super Androids). Also shown Dr. Gero's wife Vomi (who looks exactly like Android 21) & son Gevo (who inspired the design of Android 16). Although they appeared only in mention and their status shown deceased.

115,"I pretty mych enjoyed this movie, I had a couple of nitpicks and I few things that I thought was weird but if anything no matter what anyone says I think the idea of having sone Dragon ball movies where Goku and Vegeta aren't the main focus was a good call. I rather enjoyed it because it gave the characters who aren't those two a time to shine.Instead introducing a villain more powerful than the last big bad that only Goku and Vegeta can defeat let's bring in someone that would still be an issue for everyone else. Because let's be honest if someone showed up less powerful than berus while Goku and Vegeta weren't around they'd still would be an issue for everyone else because they could be a Majin Buu or Cell level world destroying threat and I'm glad this movie touched upon that.Speaking of which I agree with a few others so far others that this had a slight bio Broly feel to it and the way they brought in a new Cell felt a bit lack luster. The new Red Ribbon army, Dr. Geros grandson, and the 2 new Andriods felt like they're what made the movie.But I slightly feel bad for some fans that enjoyed Cell as a villain and expected him to get a type of comback like Freeza, it's not like it would be since he has the same cells as him, goku, and vegeta.But honestly it's fine, it's even better that defeating they new Cell went the same way as one of my other favorite dragon ball movies, ""Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug"" that instead of one person overpowering the main villain it took more of a bit of team effort and a solid plan.All in all this movie had some good steps in the right direction, a few things it could improved on, but overall I'm satisfied.",pretty mych enjoyed movie couple nitpicks things thought weird anything matter anyone says think idea sone dragon ball movies goku vegeta arent main focus good call rather enjoyed gave characters arent two time shineinstead introducing villain powerful last big bad goku vegeta defeat lets bring someone would still issue everyone else lets honest someone showed less powerful berus goku vegeta werent around theyd still would issue everyone else could majin buu cell level world destroying threat im glad movie touched upon thatspeaking agree others far others slight bio broly feel way brought new cell felt bit lack luster new red ribbon army dr geros grandson new andriods felt like theyre made moviebut slightly feel bad fans enjoyed cell villain expected get type comback like freeza like would since cells goku vegetabut honestly fine even better defeating new cell went way one favorite dragon ball movies dragon ball z lord slug instead one person overpowering main villain took bit team effort solid planall movie good steps right direction things could improved overall im satisfied
116,"I gotta admit when the first trailer of this movie was released my expectations were low I even thought that the movie would be bad thanks to the bad marketing Toei made for the movie.But now I got the chance to watch it twice and eventhough it has some flaws there's something I gotta say about this movie: IT'S GREAT!Not only the movie makes justice to Piccoro and Gohan, characters that were almost forgotten except for a decent participation at the Tournament of Force but before that they were reduced for merely comical elements and cameos.I mean how the little kid that managed to defeat Cell and his master that gave a great fight against the androids and Cell were reduced to only cameos? Damn that sucked.But now this film finally redeems those characters by taking back those elements that made the saga so iconic, comedy, actions and character development and if you are a fanboy of the manga the visual style will appeal to you for it resembles a lot the drawing style that Toriyama and Toyotaro have on paper.Now, the movie is far of being perfect like all the franchise. The main problem is that Gohan role feels rushed and sometimes a little forced like his transformation which has only a few minutes on screen and if we compare it with Piccoro's new transformation which steals the scenario, Gohan doesn't have enough time to shine, but it's not that bad for the small time he has on screen is entertaining and fun and satisfactory.The other problem I have is the villain, CELL MAX, while Bills, Freezer and Broly were characters that had enough development at their respective movies which made you feel some empathy or even love them, Cell Max lacks all of it, is the villain that's only there because the script says so, however is not that bad, those who loved the android saga will like the fight against thios now giantic guy.And finally Broly's cameo, wa ssoemthing that I expected a little more but he was reduced to a simplistic cameo to appeal the fanservice.In the end the fanservice works in most of the movie but there a scenes where it feels strange and does not connect with the.rest of the movie.But I still loved it and I dare to say that it is the best Dragon Ball movie ever made and that Toriyama still has the creativity to write the same formula that the saga has used since the 80s and work, because let's face it people, it's a formula that we love no matter if it's repetitive.",gotta admit first trailer movie released expectations low even thought movie would bad thanks bad marketing toei made moviebut got chance watch twice eventhough flaws theres something gotta say movie greatnot movie makes justice piccoro gohan characters almost forgotten except decent participation tournament force reduced merely comical elements cameosi mean little kid managed defeat cell master gave great fight androids cell reduced cameos damn suckedbut film finally redeems characters taking back elements made saga iconic comedy actions character development fanboy manga visual style appeal resembles lot drawing style toriyama toyotaro papernow movie far perfect like franchise main problem gohan role feels rushed sometimes little forced like transformation minutes screen compare piccoros new transformation steals scenario gohan doesnt enough time shine bad small time screen entertaining fun satisfactorythe problem villain cell max bills freezer broly characters enough development respective movies made feel empathy even love cell max lacks villain thats script says however bad loved android saga like fight thios giantic guyand finally brolys cameo wa ssoemthing expected little reduced simplistic cameo appeal fanservicein end fanservice works movie scenes feels strange connect therest moviebut still loved dare say best dragon ball movie ever made toriyama still creativity write formula saga used since work lets face people formula love matter repetitive
117,"PROS:
-Piccolo FINALLY got the spotlight AND a transformation!-Gamma 1 & 2 were fun antagonists.-Loved how the history of the franchise is both used and explained.-Gohan going Beast Mode.-The fights were wonderfully choreographed.-The comedy was great and reminded me of the original series.-Pan has potential to be a great character going forward.CONS:
-Not the biggest fan of the CGI animation.-Cell Max could've been more interesting.Since the anime ended in 2018, I've been wanting the series to come back. I enjoyed the Broly movie but this one really hit the spot! Piccolo is my 2nd favorite character of the franchise and it was great to see him get the spotlight for a change AND he got a new transformation! Orange Piccolo has great potential. His interactions with Pan are really heartwarming and show a different side to him than his interactions with Gohan. The villains had great ties to both the OG series and DBZ. Both Gamma 1 & 2 were fantastic as antagonists who learn that they were lied to about their enemies and ultimately join forces with our heroes. RIP Gamma 2. The fights were wonderfully realized and while I'm not a fan of the CGI animation, the choreography couldn't have been better. The Cell Max reveal was cool, but he amounted to nothing more than a mindless monster. This could've been the start of a bigger arc, but it works for the film. Overall, this is definitely in the upper echelon of Dragon Ball movies. This shows that there's still so much life left in this franchise. I can't wait for the anime to return one day but this was a great reminder of how fun Dragon Ball can be. 8/10.",pros piccolo finally got spotlight transformationgamma fun antagonistsloved history franchise used explainedgohan going beast modethe fights wonderfully choreographedthe comedy great reminded original seriespan potential great character going forwardcons biggest fan cgi animationcell max couldve interestingsince anime ended ive wanting series come back enjoyed broly movie one really hit spot piccolo nd favorite character franchise great see get spotlight change got new transformation orange piccolo great potential interactions pan really heartwarming show different side interactions gohan villains great ties og series dbz gamma fantastic antagonists learn lied enemies ultimately join forces heroes rip gamma fights wonderfully realized im fan cgi animation choreography couldnt better cell max reveal cool amounted nothing mindless monster couldve start bigger arc works film overall definitely upper echelon dragon ball movies shows theres still much life left franchise cant wait anime return one day great reminder fun dragon ball

119,"The story, the characters, the animation style are all worse than before. The main threat is just laughably bad. They try to get us with nostalgia but it doesn't work. I'm afraid that is the new (garbage) direction where we headed and not just in the anime version but also in the manga.They need to go back to the ""old"" style of animation and to the good stories with meaningful plots.There is some inconsistency with previously established skills/abilities, events and character traits (Pan, Gohan, Piccolo, Bulma).Power-ups just magically appear from nothing. I don't like that. No training, no preparation. These things just happen with no prior signs.The new androids look too generic and lack real personalities.The bad guys motivations are illogical and barely believable.Overall this movie is quite unnecessary. They should have done the Galactic Patrol Saga even if in multiple installations.",story characters animation style worse main threat laughably bad try get us nostalgia doesnt work im afraid new garbage direction headed anime version also mangathey need go back old style animation good stories meaningful plotsthere inconsistency previously established skillsabilities events character traits pan gohan piccolo bulmapowerups magically appear nothing dont like training preparation things happen prior signsthe new androids look generic lack real personalitiesthe bad guys motivations illogical barely believableoverall movie quite unnecessary done galactic patrol saga even multiple installations
120,"The movie was solid entertainment for me. The fights were good and story was fast paced. DBS broly raised the bar a little too high so some expectations took a hit. The music was subpar. The final fight with cell max was letdown because cell max was just a screaming rampaging monster.

121,"I have been a Dragon Ball fan for over 20 years, and I really enjoyed DBS Superhero.(I saw it in Japanese today for my 3rd viewing (23/8/22 and it was great. But I prefer the dub. The English cast did a fantastic job!)It was a major throwback for me. (as a blend of old and new concepts in the Dragon Ball universe.)I honestly prefer old school Dragon Ball from the 80s and 90s, but for what it is, I appreciated the fact that Piccolo in particular was given the spotlight in this film!It was long overdue and they finally gave Piccolo the respect he deserves, especially in regards to being a better mentor and father figure than Goku.Gohan is back in top form here as well. His new form is badass. Hopefully the trend continues with Gohan resuming his training.He really needs to be a bigger focus in future Dragon Ball installments, as I'm getting a bit tired of how they dumbed down Goku. Gohan acts more maturely and logically than ""Super Goku"".It was refreshing to see something Dragon Ball related that puts Goku and Vegeta in the backseat.Hopefully more side characters get some spotlight in the next film. Tien would be a great lead character choice!I've seen the movie three times in the theatre and I thought that the animation was done really well, despite it being completely CGI.The art is a mixture of old and new. It took viewing it a second time to really appreciate what they were going for with the change of art style.Some parts slightly resemble old style DBZ, but at it's core, it isn't as gritty or violent in its presentation as the older films in the series.There is still a lack of blood and guts. I assume this is because Toei wants kids to enjoy the movie.It's not quite as good as the old school DBZ movies, but it's still more enjoyable than Super Broly for me! Only because I felt as if the original Broly movies from the 90s are better.Pan was far less annoying and much more endearing here, than in her GT incarnation.Every character, apart from Cell, was given a purpose and a reason to be present during the film.Even Krillin helped out with that awesome solar flare in Cell's face. Krillin wasn't completely useless this time!Gotenks was cool to see again, but it would have been better if the fusion was successful. SS3 is underutilized as it is.The fight scenes were epic and grand. The soundtrack was my favourite so far in a Dragon Ball movie. It really captured the themes of superheroes in the film.Yes, this movie follows a similar formula to many other Dragon Ball titles, but that's to be expected.The Red Ribbon Army was a cool idea to implement in this movie. The bad guys made me laugh quite a few times. Even with small things like the commander having an Oreo dispenser in his car!The only thing I could say disappointed me is that Cell wasn't really utilised as anything more than a ""big bad"" at the end of the movie.They didn't really give him much to do. It was cool to see Cell make a comeback, but it would have been nice for him to have some proper dialogue.I enjoyed the blend of comedy and action elements in the movie.This captures what Dragon Ball is meant to be. Dragon Ball is not completely about fighting, it always had elements of slapstick and ridiculousness.So, they managed to bring most things together quite well in my opinion. (With the exception of Bulma being a little too obsessed with her body parts LOL!)I will be buying a copy on Bluray or at least streaming it when the movie is available as a home release.A fun, entertaining and colourful entry in the Dragon Ball franchise!

It is pure fan service.Ultimate gohan throws a few punches, piccolo powers up like gohan did in namek, pan is rely funny!!!I just don't follow on the 3D style. Why not like browly again?

123,"To be honest, the movie's plot was pretty boring. Giving Piccolo and Gohan spotlight was definitely the best thing this movie decided to do, as well as the new power-ups.

124,"I'm just going to rate it a 3 on the account that honestly I hated around 90% of it. The androids were cool, didn't think they would be, but no yeah they were actually cool. Orange Piccolo ended up being cool and Beast Gohan, but at the end of the day how much of these 3 things did we really get? 20 minutes max out of the whole movie? Or something similar to that. The fight between Beast and Cell was incredibly short too. I don't really care if it uses the main characters or not, I feel like these two deserved some winning by themselves for once screen time but like 90% of it was just life, family and drama and the most minuscule amount of it was actual fighting.Hated most of the animations too and that extra stuff that appeared, the names etc, sorry that wasn't for me.By the time I actually started to like it, it ended essentially.Glad that I finally got around to seeing it though, that it was on special and that I could watch it, but yeah sorry major disappointment for me.I think realistically DBZ fight scenes, watching them and only them throughout the years spoiled me and yeah my falling in love with Zamasu and my stories etc. I need something to be going on neigh 24/7, could care less about family and family drama, I want drama against two enemies, the fun type of drama, not that boring family stuff.Even dramatic drama filled dreams fill me with immense mood enhancers upon waking up and for the rest of the day, but boring dreams get forgotten. Had Zamasu and Black attacking a city in my dream last night, woke up feeling like a million bucks.

126,"Mediocre film. Positive note is that Goku and Vegeta do not see each other very little. Negative notes are the story is of a practically absent originality all things already seen and reviewed in other sauces, a CGI that does not convince, a bland sound. The film (and in general the franchise) is rubbish that is aimed at an audience of 12 -14 year olds, however I recognize that DB knows that it is an empty and bland work and does not pretend to be anything else: it does not try to bring existentialism and then fall into ridicule. A forgettable and mediocre film, Dragon Ball is a boiled and infactile franchise.",mediocre film positive note goku vegeta see little negative notes story practically absent originality things already seen reviewed sauces cgi convince bland sound film general franchise rubbish aimed audience year olds however recognize db knows empty bland work pretend anything else try bring existentialism fall ridicule forgettable mediocre film dragon ball boiled infactile franchise
127,"Let's get the obvious out of the way. This is probably the worst animation for a professional film I've ever seen. It was insulting. How can these guys who make over a hundred million from the Broly movie off a ""small"" budget, and look at this low frame rate and lifeless CGI and allow it to go into production?? The biggest problem with the CGI was the frame rate. It's choppy. So none of the movement even looks fluid it's awful. What is this, 5 frames per second? Furthermore there is no touch up to make anything look halfway decent. I heard they had animators go over each frame and rework it but it looks flat. This literally looks like they ripped off a fan made animation. And even for CGI, this is bad quality. In 2022 WHY is a movie coming from a conglomerate such as Dragonball looking like it should be released for the Playstation 2 as a videogame trailer? There is no excuse for this, they knew it wasn't good and released it anyways. If they did this because their staff was working on other things, then wait. It's not worth wasting everyones time and money. I really wanted to rate this lower but the story was so true to Toriyamas style. This is the saving grace. It's really a great story which had a lot of potential to be the nostalgic show we all remember. First of all, it had a lot of little surprises. The spar between Goku and Vegeta, even Broly training with them, the humor, the peaceful scenes and the entire story built up at a very good pace. It starts giving background to the Red Ribbon Army, which probably used some plot armor of Geros relative being unusually gifted, but dragonball has always used things to push the plot along. They had some of the plans from cell which helped them recreate him but stronger and some new androids were introduced. Gohan and Piccolo for the first time in a long time get to shine. They added some nice, subtle comedic elements and the story mostly focused around Piccolo. When everyone gets together and starts fighting it seems rushed how Gohan is dragged and probably out of character for Piccolo to allow it. So the writing wasn't perfect but it was interesting. Only at this point, Gohan has no time for character development or training since Piccolo was the one who got the power up from a wish to the dragon. Gohan later gets the power up the only way he can which is getting upset. It's an old trope for him and they buff him up way too much. Back in the day the heros used to have to earn their power ups. But the entire franchise of Dragonball has really stopped caring about the training stages. And this doesn't allow them to break the action sequences with peaceful ones. Interestingly this film did have a lot of peaceful filler but it didn't balance it with a rational reason as to how Gohan would get stronger. Training in the hyperbolic time chamber or a wish would have helped make it make more sense. Although I don't like how lately they use the Dragon so often for power ups. Otherwise, it was hilarious to see Vegeta beat Goku after the credits. Finally!All I kept thinking is, what would I have thought of the movie if it was animated? I am thinking I would have enjoyed it a lot more.If you are a big fan or just looking to have fun without too much judgement, you might be able to bare watching this. But really, I can understand fans that don't bother watching it based on the poor animation alone.For all the people who say it allows new angles like rotating the camera, the Brolly movie had some things like that and honestly that's not such a big deal. Even if that was the case, the CGI was bad even for CGI standards. Giving it a 7/10 is probably too generous, although I suppose there was potential for a good movie.",lets get obvious way probably worst animation professional film ive ever seen insulting guys make hundred million broly movie small budget look low frame rate lifeless cgi allow go production biggest problem cgi frame rate choppy none movement even looks fluid awful frames per second furthermore touch make anything look halfway decent heard animators go frame rework looks flat literally looks like ripped fan made animation even cgi bad quality movie coming conglomerate dragonball looking like released playstation videogame trailer excuse knew wasnt good released anyways staff working things wait worth wasting everyones time money really wanted rate lower story true toriyamas style saving grace really great story lot potential nostalgic show remember first lot little surprises spar goku vegeta even broly training humor peaceful scenes entire story built good pace starts giving background red ribbon army probably used plot armor geros relative unusually gifted dragonball always used things push plot along plans cell helped recreate stronger new androids introduced gohan piccolo first time long time get shine added nice subtle comedic elements story mostly focused around piccolo everyone gets together starts fighting seems rushed gohan dragged probably character piccolo allow writing wasnt perfect interesting point gohan time character development training since piccolo one got power wish dragon gohan later gets power way getting upset old trope buff way much back day heros used earn power ups entire franchise dragonball really stopped caring training stages doesnt allow break action sequences peaceful ones interestingly film lot peaceful filler didnt balance rational reason gohan would get stronger training hyperbolic time chamber wish would helped make make sense although dont like lately use dragon often power ups otherwise hilarious see vegeta beat goku credits finallyall kept thinking would thought movie animated thinking would enjoyed lot moreif big fan looking fun without much judgement might able bare watching really understand fans dont bother watching based poor animation alonefor people say allows new angles like rotating camera brolly movie things like honestly thats big deal even case cgi bad even cgi standards giving probably generous although suppose potential good movie
128,"I didn't mind the new animation. Wish it could stay the same, but that's progress. It's definitely a more fluid motion to watch. It wasn't really distracting.Story was fun, even the villains were redeeming which I loved. They weren't afraid of killing a main character. They get points for that honesty and bravery with the story telling.They're never short of lore with the past. It's good that the audience has evolved to a point we don't care wHere the problems come from, we just want to see them resolved with good old fashioned butt kicking. I think the writers of the movies haVe that perspective nailed. For example, though the exposition seemed kind of like a stretch, we didn't care. The new villains were silly yet serious and overwhelmingly likable-something dragon ball has always constructed well throughout.Some stuff was a bit of a misstep. Goku and Vegeta were basically not useful beyond humor. They didn't kick much booty towArds each other. It made the entire side stuff with them and Beerus seem fun, but not pivotal. More like faN service to hear iconic English voice actors. However, that cAnt necessary be the case for the English actors alone. I'm sure the Japanese actors who voice Goku and Vegeta have been on it for years. Or maybe not. Either way, my impression of their banter and situation was simply fan service nonetheless.I also don't know why buu is even relevant anymore. I did like the throwback ideas all the way to dragonball however( piccolo getting swole, etc) I think they have so much greaT lore to use and they don't disappoint bringing back old techniques aNd ideaS to reinvent new situations for dynamic effect. It's clear to me having grown up on old schoo dbz, movies ( which weren't the most inventive and usualLy predictable as hell) that the new stuff listened to the fans and have put more effort into the movies in generaL.Even minuscule roles have descent comedic timing and typically serve some kind of purpose towards the story. Even for a witty comedic moment to land with an obscure minor reference to previous dialogue does well here. It makes us feel like there's continuity and thoughtfulness in a world where everything may have gotten stale from traditional dbz beatem ups.Overall the movies main baddy was literally mindlesss in its monstrousity, which disengaged us from a sincere sense of threat. When he was revealed it was clear we (living vicariously through the dbz squad) were probably going to prevail. Gohan is a likable dude, but his latent ability hardly seemed useful beyond one blast so great! But ultimately who cares? It was used for twEnty seconds. Piccolo on the other hand was the ultimate gangster, definitely led the charge on delivering good humor, fighting, and a sense of development in the story.They did a lot with him. I didn't mind it. Gone are the days when he was more reserved. The comedy and spectacle call for a more vulnerable and heartfelt character, and Christopher Sabat delivers here. Perhaps splendidly so. His powers were the most intriguing yet, and I liked the dimension the dialogue brought to him. It was refreshing. He was a bit quirky, but it's time to level up his character to become more in line with what this new format of dbz really brings:Better fights, zany situations, light hearted yet brave characters wiling to die for a good cause, and fun humor for todays audience.I thoroughly enjoyed the show. And while it did feel like a staging ground for another big development, I found delight in the problem the z fighters ultimately triumphed in solving.Another misstep to mention though:
I do think Pan was used in a way that was somewhat mediocre. She was simply used as a tool to incite Gohans rage and potential. I get it, he became soft, but don't manipulate the dude by triggering him through the abuse towards his daughter. I give Piccolo a pass, because I know his character had the best of intentions, but I'm looking at the writers in particular when I say ""be careful, you walk a dangerous line which could polarize the audience to your cause of telling a good story through the manipulation of a child in your heroes development"" That is all. It may have worked back then, but it was never so overt as the willful tactics used towards the end of the movie.Otherwise, great stuff.

Fantastic Dragonball movie
Solid film . Great action , likeable characters, and awesome moments . People will always find ways to pick apart anything dragonball related but if you go into this with an open mind and to simply just watch some new dragonball content you'll be extremely satisfied . The new animation is fantastic during fight scenes and the characters hold very true to the anime. You'll see a ton of negative reviews complaining about the new style but after about 5 minutes in to the movie you'll hardly even realise it's CGI it stays that true to the 2D animation stuff. The humour worked well and the action scenes are up there with the best in the series (have no clue why people are complaining about this).

131,"As for the story, this film is a bland 4-5, but I really appreciate its contribution in other aspects such as its 3D animation with very well applied CGI and that (finally) takes the focus off the common protagonists and focuses on a conflict simpler but just as entertaining in a really short movie (less than 2 hours) and hopefully they bet on more movies like this since DB movies are characterized by not being very good from DBZ onwards. Although this is not far from that concept of the masses, the intention to reinvent DB films is noticeable and that is something very correct and with its popularity at the box office and in criticism, the path that this work will take here in a few years seems encouraging to me.

At first they were only able to pair to Super Saiyan, but now the new models gave gone even further.The other problem I have is Piccolo's design. His skin is more yellowish for some reason than green. Vertical stripes on his arms have vanished and he has five fingers. I would even buy his new form, because it was nice to see Piccolo relevant again, but a logo showing up on the back of his clothes as he transforms feels more like Digimon than Dragon ball.The third and final problem was Gohan. Although his character finally recieved development and motivation, but his new form looks like something dan made and not a true Saiyan transformation.All in all the movie was fun to watch, had a couple of laughs and the score was great.",enjoyable movie however couple issues main premise funny gohan piccolo finally got shine againalthough story fresh approach dragon ball like dragon ball z feel androids made humans seem much power first able pair super saiyan new models gave gone even furtherthe problem piccolos design skin yellowish reason green vertical stripes arms vanished five fingers would even buy new form nice see piccolo relevant logo showing back clothes transforms feels like digimon dragon ballthe third final problem gohan although character finally recieved development motivation new form looks like something dan made true saiyan transformationall movie fun watch couple laughs score great

You barely see it's 3D compared to the previous.There is a lot of camera movements (mostly during the fighting scenes), something that would never be achievable in 2D animation. The purists will say it's not genuine DB-style but it makes it so much more ""realistic"" and vivid to me.The scenes where flashback moments are shown from the older DBZ were also redone, the difference is huge, a DBZ Kai ""remastered"" would be a great idea if you see what the result could be.The story itself is typical DBZ style, I miss a bit of originality in the story and the antagonist.Nonetheless, if you are (were?) a DBZ-fan I would advice you to watch this movie.",started watching movie bit sceptic super broly movie years agothe level animation much better movie compared super broly movie barely see compared previousthere lot camera movements mostly fighting scenes something would never achievable animation purists say genuine dbstyle makes much realistic vivid methe scenes flashback moments shown older dbz also redone difference huge dbz kai remastered would great idea see result could bethe story typical dbz style miss bit originality story antagonistnonetheless dbzfan would advice watch movie
136,"The animation style is what you'd expect from one of the modern video games' cut scenes, which was a turnoff for me, especially with how beautiful the newer Broly movie was.Assuming this movie is cannon, it was made solely to re-establish Piccolo and Gohan as significant characters that can actually assist in universal threats, which, based on Battle of the Gods, will probably be retold in the Super series anyway. It also establishes Broly as an ally-in-training, for the whole 7 minutes he was in it.Combine Bio-Broly with the finale of the Cell Saga with a sprinkle of Radditz's death, there's your movie.Expect nothing from Goku or Vegeta, they are only relevant to establish Broly as a new ally while training with Whis.Overall, the movie was entertaining, but it felt like I was watching a rehash of the previously mentioned moments in the Dragon Ball series. At times, I could get past the animation style, but for the most part, it was a big distraction.If you want to know the only relevant parts of the movie without taking the time or spending money to see it, just Google Piccolo and Gohan's new forms, especially if you want to avoid seeing Gohan not do any fighting in his new ""Beast"" form.",animation style youd expect one modern video games cut scenes turnoff especially beautiful newer broly movie wasassuming movie cannon made solely reestablish piccolo gohan significant characters actually assist universal threats based battle gods probably retold super series anyway also establishes broly allyintraining whole minutes itcombine biobroly finale cell saga sprinkle radditzs death theres movieexpect nothing goku vegeta relevant establish broly new ally training whisoverall movie entertaining felt like watching rehash previously mentioned moments dragon ball series times could get past animation style part big distractionif want know relevant parts movie without taking time spending money see google piccolo gohans new forms especially want avoid seeing gohan fighting new beast form

Also, I found the humor quite amusing.Speaking of the negative aspects, I didn't like the new androids, which are basically a less characterized version of Goku and Vegeta, and this kaiju version of Cell.

VERY BAD: CGIGohan was always my favorite, and it was time we were reminded of how strong he can be. But it doesn't make any sense how he could power up that much since he hasn't trained for years, apparently. That 'hidden potential' line isn't enough. As for Piccolo, he's always a cool character to explore. Pan was extremely cute. And Bulma funny as ever.I grew up watching Dragon Ball, and animation quality has decreased significantly after DBZ, with some exceptions in Super. This CGI is just visually horrible, like a bad quality video game, and they took one of the key elements: the hair. I still have to understand what Gohan had in his head after his new transformation, because that was not hair. Let's hope they go back to a more traditional animation... and for a new season, also keep it short like so many other anime: less episodes with better overall quality.About the story, it had its moments but there were too many nostalgic elements, and enemies weren't a real threat. May be that's why it looks like a very long and low quality filler episode.",sum upgood characters sound effects bad story storytelling enemies bad cgigohan always favorite time reminded strong doesnt make sense could power much since hasnt trained years apparently hidden potential line isnt enough piccolo hes always cool character explore pan extremely cute bulma funny everi grew watching dragon ball animation quality decreased significantly dbz exceptions super cgi visually horrible like bad quality video game took one key elements hair still understand gohan head new transformation hair lets hope go back traditional animation new season also keep short like many anime less episodes better overall qualityabout story moments many nostalgic elements enemies werent real threat may thats looks like long low quality filler episode
139,"The intro is a lot of filler from Dragon Ball and DBZ regarding Dr. Gero, the Androids, Cell, and so on. So the first 3 to 5 minutes can be really dull if you know your dragon ball lore/events.A really slow start to the movie with a few good scenes between Piccolo and Pan (Pan is just wholesome throughout this entire movie).Some filler stuff with Goku and Vegeta training together that didn't need to be in this movie, since we are mainly focusing on Piccolo, Gohan, and the Red Ribbon army.Gohan's current state as a character I still hate and he has been uninteresting since the Cell SAGA that came out over 20 years ago. He's probably the blandest character in this movie.Piccolo's screen time with his first transformation ever was a little short to my liking, since it's the first time he ever changes looks and I think they should've put more focus on him evolving rather than skipping through it (But that's definitely more of a problem with another character).Orange Piccolo is kind of a weird/unoriginal name, but fits the character that he doesn't want to be much of a show of and just focuses on the fighting aspect.As always in Shonen movies, the fight scenes are the best part with the environmental destruction and the color of the energy blasts is really nice to look at.We kind of have a Wolverine: Origins moment where they literally take one of (if not the most) charismatic characters in Dragon Ball history and make him not speak. Cell Max just has a monkey brain through this entire movie and just yells and screams like he's just come from the insane asylum. Cell is definitely the most disappointing part of this movie.And finally, we also have a moment that I thought would be cool, but just gets really lame. Gohan finally goes through a new transformation and he is in this transformation for ONLY 2 MINUTES. They literally had more screen time for Goku and Vegeta fighting than showing off Gohan finally using some of his hidden powers.The end credit scene is more of a lame nod to the fans that Vegeta finally beat Goku. Instead of having a movie or episode in Super where they duke it out for real, we get them fighting off-screen for this entire movie. Again really lame and wish they finally would have shown some more respect to Vegeta as a character and made this moment more special for the character.",intro lot filler dragon ball dbz regarding dr gero androids cell first minutes really dull know dragon ball loreeventsa really slow start movie good scenes piccolo pan pan wholesome throughout entire moviesome filler stuff goku vegeta training together didnt need movie since mainly focusing piccolo gohan red ribbon armygohans current state character still hate uninteresting since cell saga came years ago hes probably blandest character moviepiccolos screen time first transformation ever little short liking since first time ever changes looks think shouldve put focus evolving rather skipping thats definitely problem another characterorange piccolo kind weirdunoriginal name fits character doesnt want much show focuses fighting aspectas always shonen movies fight scenes best part environmental destruction color energy blasts really nice look atwe kind wolverine origins moment literally take one charismatic characters dragon ball history make speak cell max monkey brain entire movie yells screams like hes come insane asylum cell definitely disappointing part movieand finally also moment thought would cool gets really lame gohan finally goes new transformation transformation minutes literally screen time goku vegeta fighting showing gohan finally using hidden powersthe end credit scene lame nod fans vegeta finally beat goku instead movie episode super duke real get fighting offscreen entire movie really lame wish finally would shown respect vegeta character made moment special character

142,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I have grown up watching Dragon Ball Z and its movies from the age of 4, and can confidently say this is the worst DBZ movie by far. It isn't even DBZ anymore, just some cringe movie the directors made and put a DBZ sticker on. I can't even begin to say all of the flaws in this movie. Normally I'd look past cringey scenes/plot and a badly written script if the animation was solid and the fights were good, but even both of those were terrible. I went into this movie with extremely low expectations after seeing the terrible trailer, but the directors still managed to surprise me with how bad it was. Whoever thinks this is a solid DBZ movie is not a true Dragon Ball fan.",one worst movies ever seen grown watching dragon ball z movies age confidently say worst dbz movie far isnt even dbz anymore cringe movie directors made put dbz sticker cant even begin say flaws movie normally id look past cringey scenesplot badly written script animation solid fights good even terrible went movie extremely low expectations seeing terrible trailer directors still managed surprise bad whoever thinks solid dbz movie true dragon ball fan
143,"The Dragon Ball Super story continues with its steady reboot of the anime that started it all. Super Hero adds a creative superhero theme, portrays the story from a much needed different perspective and like its predecessor (Dragon Ball Super: Broly), offers a new modern animation style. While the return of the classic Red Ribbon Army was welcomed, Dragon Ball Super continues its trend of relying on old, weaker versions of villains. Super Hero also carries on Super's recent disruption of the power scales in the Dragon Ball Universe.I enjoyed the new spin of the superhero theme in the film. A smart creative choice by the writers; most likely capitalising on the MCU wave and bringing it into the anime realm. It also added a fun and comedic flair to the film which may remind fans of the iconic, Great Saiyaman!I'm glad they chose to tell the story from Piccolo's perspective rather than Goku and Vegeta; I am growing tired of the show's reliance on Goku to save the day. Therefore, I am pleased to see they are trying to bring other beloved characters into the foreground who can have an actual impact when they take on the ""final boss"" in a story arc. The show's creators are also finally becoming aware that they need to bring back Gohan!When I first saw the trailer for the film, I was very concerned about the new CGI animation approach because it looked very clunky and plastic. However, I can say that the animation looked fresh and smooth. The CGI actually enhanced the colour and vibrancy during the action sequences; each fight involving energy blasts looked like an explosion of colour. Despite that, I am still hoping that bring back the ""comic-book style animation"" from the recent Broly film.As expected from a Dragon Ball Super film, the action was great. There was a great combination of hand to hand combat and energy attacks.The Dragon Ball series has progressed so much since the Red Ribbon army so it was a pleasant surprise to see them making a return. I did not enjoy the return of the genetically engineered, monstrous version of Cell. It does so much disservice to Cell and the unique personality he had. Furthermore, they pulled his similar strategy in the film, Dragon Ball Z: Bio-Broly and that was not well received by fans.Super Hero also continues to blur Dragon Ball Super's power scale. They made Piccolo more powerful, yet at the same time he hardly made a difference in the combat sequences. Goten and Trunks also make an appearance but appear weaker than ever.Overall, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero was a fun film and still keeps the spirit of the anime that started it all, alive.",dragon ball super story continues steady reboot anime started super hero adds creative superhero theme portrays story much needed different perspective like predecessor dragon ball super broly offers new modern animation style return classic red ribbon army welcomed dragon ball super continues trend relying old weaker versions villains super hero also carries supers recent disruption power scales dragon ball universei enjoyed new spin superhero theme film smart creative choice writers likely capitalising mcu wave bringing anime realm also added fun comedic flair film may remind fans iconic great saiyamanim glad chose tell story piccolos perspective rather goku vegeta growing tired shows reliance goku save day therefore pleased see trying bring beloved characters foreground actual impact take final boss story arc shows creators also finally becoming aware need bring back gohanwhen first saw trailer film concerned new cgi animation approach looked clunky plastic however say animation looked fresh smooth cgi actually enhanced colour vibrancy action sequences fight involving energy blasts looked like explosion colour despite still hoping bring back comicbook style animation recent broly filmas expected dragon ball super film action great great combination hand hand combat energy attacksthe dragon ball series progressed much since red ribbon army pleasant surprise see making return enjoy return genetically engineered monstrous version cell much disservice cell unique personality furthermore pulled similar strategy film dragon ball z biobroly well received fanssuper hero also continues blur dragon ball supers power scale made piccolo powerful yet time hardly made difference combat sequences goten trunks also make appearance appear weaker everoverall dragon ball super super hero fun film still keeps spirit anime started alive
144,"I am a DBZ/ DBS fan boy and so I do have a little bias and will praise the move slightly better than if I wasn't a fan. So lets get started from best to worst.The animation was amazing. I thought some scenes were so beautiful and vibrant. At first i was taken off by the drastic change in animation, eventually started to appreciate the well rendered details and richness of all the colors. I still prefer the 2d art and i truly don't want this to become the norm but it definitely was a nice experimental take which it should stay that way.Piccolo transformation was cool. I liked it. Yes, it could of been better and maybe somewhat more creative but for what it is, it works and was well needed.You finally see pan and more amazingly, goten and trunks grow up.Gohan's transformation looks sick, but thats all. Where they really dropped the ball and hurt themselves is Gohan didn't really fight or have any real significant screen time in his new transformation. If Gohan fought more it would have redeemed a lot of the negatives of this movie.The action is general was not enough. Don't get me wrong, they had a good amount of action in it but not enough esp to dbz/ dbs standards. Again, only if they showed gohan in his new transformation fight more would have made up for this and would have probably made the move much better in dbz/ super standards.The plot was so boring and uncreative. I know this is dbz and super we are talking about, not known for having the most amazing story or plot except for some rare instances but even for dbz and super standards this was lacking in anything close to a good story.All in all, I give it a 6 purely due to gohan and piccolo desperately needing power ups to stay relevant and fill that gap in power between vegeta and goku. Finally, seeing trunk and goten grow up disappointedly but hey they still aged, finally. I also kind of like what they are doing with pan.",dbz dbs fan boy little bias praise move slightly better wasnt fan lets get started best worstthe animation amazing thought scenes beautiful vibrant first taken drastic change animation eventually started appreciate well rendered details richness colors still prefer art truly dont want become norm definitely nice experimental take stay waypiccolo transformation cool liked yes could better maybe somewhat creative works well neededyou finally see pan amazingly goten trunks grow upgohans transformation looks sick thats really dropped ball hurt gohan didnt really fight real significant screen time new transformation gohan fought would redeemed lot negatives moviethe action general enough dont get wrong good amount action enough esp dbz dbs standards showed gohan new transformation fight would made would probably made move much better dbz super standardsthe plot boring uncreative know dbz super talking known amazing story plot except rare instances even dbz super standards lacking anything close good storyall give purely due gohan piccolo desperately needing power ups stay relevant fill gap power vegeta goku finally seeing trunk goten grow disappointedly hey still aged finally also kind like pan

150,"The great thing about this movie is that you can feel the true spirit of Dragon Ball. By now we all know that Goku and Vegeta are super strong and unsurpassable and that's exactly why giving space to the other characters was such a good gimmick. Until the end there was no certainty whether Gohan and the others would be able to make it on their own or whether Goku, Vegeta and Broly would step in. Also, it is very appreciable that Piccolo, out of instinct, did not ask the Dragon to defeat the antagonists for him or even take Goku and Vegeta to planet earth. A choice based perhaps on arrogance, pride, or simply on not relying 100% on the dragon and also relying on his own strength (in line with the lecture given to Gohan), a solution that in the end gave depth to the plot and a chance for powerups to our favourite Namekian and the missed main protagonist: Gohan. It's also a great idea to use the Makankosappo as the final attack instead of the Kamehameha. Firstly, it is the perfect technique to defeat Cell as it is a high-precision and super-effective blow to destroy the villain's regenerating core. Secondly, it represents Gohan's great connection with Piccolo, just as the Father Son Kamehameha in DBZ (against Perfect Cell) highlights the connection with his father Goku.The difference is that this time Gohan, in addition to being more mature, is a father himself and this gives greater importance to the bond with Piccolo, who was actually much more present than Goku as a parental figure, not only for Gohan, but also for little Pan. Overall it's a very successful and coherent film.Highly recommended and a deserved 8/10 stars.",great thing movie feel true spirit dragon ball know goku vegeta super strong unsurpassable thats exactly giving space characters good gimmick end certainty whether gohan others would able make whether goku vegeta broly would step also appreciable piccolo instinct ask dragon defeat antagonists even take goku vegeta planet earth choice based perhaps arrogance pride simply relying dragon also relying strength line lecture given gohan solution end gave depth plot chance powerups favourite namekian missed main protagonist gohan also great idea use makankosappo final attack instead kamehameha firstly perfect technique defeat cell highprecision supereffective blow destroy villains regenerating core secondly represents gohans great connection piccolo father son kamehameha dbz perfect cell highlights connection father gokuthe difference time gohan addition mature father gives greater importance bond piccolo actually much present goku parental figure gohan also little pan overall successful coherent filmhighly recommended deserved stars

Again, the animation of the characters was so off it looked like fan art from photoshop.Lastly is the creation of Cell Max. This was one of the worst parts of the movie, being that they claimed he was far superior to the original Cell. But he could not talk, he didn't heal automatically, or regenerate, and he was unrealistically large like a giant. No back story to how they improved him from the original (did they get cells from other aliens that visit the planet like Beerus, or Whis etc?) They should have definitely kept him closer to the original Perfect Cell but more powerful and intelligent and change his appearance slightly. Having Wings was pointless as pretty much everyone can fly with energy.. he could have powered up to fly away instead of using his wings..Great Plot though, had a good story too it.

But to my surprise I genuinely enjoyed the movie. It was really fun and lighthearted story, that casual (in this series) like me, would like. I could understand why some fans of the series might hate it as it's just a filler and doesn't really feature main characters that much or add some depth to the story and so on. Does the story have some deeper meaning? No. Does it rely on Dragon Ball on Dragon Ball series' jokes? Yes. But it's the nostalgia and some Dragon Ball well known shticks, that made whole theater burst out laughing several times during the movie. This self-awarness and campiness is what really sold me on it (also Piccolo and his big titties being main protagonist(-s), honestly, I remember liking Piccolo as a kid and this movie brought back that fondness, but in a slightly different way). Didn't mind the 3d animation, just in faster paced action scenes did it bother me a bit with cgi being too visible (if that makes sense). The color palette for the movie was pretty too.

161,"The story focuses around Piccolo and Gohan, which is very refreshing, and the story develops in a satisfying way imo.I'm not saying it looked bad, but it did look worse, cheap, and unnatural. Plenty of anime uses CGI for characters, but in the good ones you don't notice (unlimited bladeworks for example). You definitely notice in this one. With drawn characters, artists are able to stretch things, add motion, and produce art that can better display movement. But the 3D makes the characters look stiff, lifeless, and like they're made of plastic. It honestly looks like a video game, and that's pretty offensive because this isn't a new series, it has a preexisting art style and they changed it, so of course that's an issue. I just don't think 3D animators are very talented, and I want them to stick to video games and Saturday morning Disney shows.",story focuses around piccolo gohan refreshing story develops satisfying way imoim saying looked bad look worse cheap unnatural plenty anime uses cgi characters good ones dont notice unlimited bladeworks example definitely notice one drawn characters artists able stretch things add motion produce art better display movement makes characters look stiff lifeless like theyre made plastic honestly looks like video game thats pretty offensive isnt new series preexisting art style changed course thats issue dont think animators talented want stick video games saturday morning disney shows

165,"As A Dragon Ball Fan From India It Was Delight To Watch It In Theatre After So Many Years And As Toriyama's Statements That Gohan Can Be Powerful If He Wanted To, This Time We Saw It. Goku & Vegeta Don't Get Much Time In This Movie It's Properly Based On Piccolo & Gohan. Plot Of Movie Is 100% Dragon Ball Style Action Filled With Situational Comedy But As Run Time Is Less Movie Lacks In Properly Setting The Plot. Also The Animation Style That Dragon Ball Used Is Pretty Unique This Time And It Should Be Given A Chance Watching Such New Animation Style In Theatres Worked For Me But It Varies For Everyone.

166,Been a loyal fan of the dragon ball franchise for 25+ years and this film really reinforced what my feelings have been for the last couple years.I enjoyed the Latest Broly film and there was some good parts of dragon ball super but on the whole they have ruined the franchise through making it seems like the audience they are aiming for are very young children? If you compare this latest film with dragon ball Z it really is sad to see how much it has regressed. I was sat in the cinema and it was actually to the point where it was painful it was that bad! No wonder fan made dragon ball anime on YT is getting removed when it is so much better than the rubbish they seem to be producing now!The transformations in this particular film make absolute no sense and the animation imo is shockingly bad. This was the GOAT programme but now the likes of demon slayer and AOT is leaving dragon ball for dust!I cannot understand how people who are life long dragon ball fans can rate this film so highly? I never write reviews but I was that disappointed I felt I had to!,loyal fan dragon ball franchise years film really reinforced feelings last couple yearsi enjoyed latest broly film good parts dragon ball super whole ruined franchise making seems like audience aiming young children compare latest film dragon ball z really sad see much regressed sat cinema actually point painful bad wonder fan made dragon ball anime yt getting removed much better rubbish seem producing nowthe transformations particular film make absolute sense animation imo shockingly bad goat programme likes demon slayer aot leaving dragon ball dusti cannot understand people life long dragon ball fans rate film highly never write reviews disappointed felt
167,First of all the story is really just a mix of android/cell saga and bio broly movie. Which would have been ok as DB movies never have stories imho. Its more about the villain and cool action.And this is where the problems begin. That cell Monster? Idk I think it sucked. Piccolo is really the mvp of this movie. Spy action. Clever moves. Wishes from shenron. Tacniques he didnt use since classic DB. Its all there and I loved it. His new form im a little torn. I think the fact he finally gets simething is awesome. Well deserved screentime here.Gohan tho? Honestly the movie could have been a 8 or 9 for me if gohan was just completely not in it. Its so annoying he just transforms into something not even very special in the end and blasts the big bad dead. With piccolos move that he never used before. Stupid. Devalued piccolos power up big time and really destroyed the whole movie. At least for me.,first story really mix androidcell saga bio broly movie would ok db movies never stories imho villain cool actionand problems begin cell monster idk think sucked piccolo really mvp movie spy action clever moves wishes shenron tacniques didnt use since classic db loved new form im little torn think fact finally gets simething awesome well deserved screentime heregohan tho honestly movie could gohan completely annoying transforms something even special end blasts big bad dead piccolos move never used stupid devalued piccolos power big time really destroyed whole movie least
168,"A great addition to Super if you're a casual DBZ/S fan, and a must-watch if you're a Piccolo or Gohan fan! Man, did it feel refreshing to see them take the spotlight! Its issues mostly lie with pacing and way too much Red Ribbon backstory clogging up the run time, the worst offender being Toei missing a perfect opportunity to reprise Great Saiyaman, ESPECIALLY when ""superhero"" is its namesake!The comedy was on-point and had me laughing at every other line! Pan was adorable and the Gammas were love at first sight; they stole the second act and had the best fight in the movie. The CG is well-done and and really takes advantage of the cinematography and fighting choreography. I wouldn't put it in my Top 5 DBZ/S movies, but it has a place in my Top 10 for a DBZ/S marathon.",great addition super youre casual dbzs fan mustwatch youre piccolo gohan fan man feel refreshing see take spotlight issues mostly lie pacing way much red ribbon backstory clogging run time worst offender toei missing perfect opportunity reprise great saiyaman especially superhero namesakethe comedy onpoint laughing every line pan adorable gammas love first sight stole second act best fight movie cg welldone really takes advantage cinematography fighting choreography wouldnt put top dbzs movies place top dbzs marathon
169,As title states. Highly disappointed in this and I've tried every single outlet short of Disney plus. If anybody has the link and is capable of sharing it with me that would be great. I just want to watch the movie but I like in Canada and that apparently makes me ineligible to watch the movie. It makes zero sense also that I have to write 600 words just to make this complaint. North America needs to regulate its viewing licenses better and have a proper control over who may and who may not view or purchase content. 1/10 and that's going to stay that way. How absurd is it that this far passed release I still can't watch it in Canada.,title states highly disappointed ive tried every single outlet short disney plus anybody link capable sharing would great want watch movie like canada apparently makes ineligible watch movie makes zero sense also write words make complaint north america needs regulate viewing licenses better proper control may may view purchase content thats going stay way absurd far passed release still cant watch canada
170,"This movie was very bad, Dragon ball characters have always been characterized by showing their personality, in this movie the villain doesn't even say a word, he has no personality.Some people who have always been in the story lose their essence, for example Bulma leaves aside the technology for aesthetic things, as well as Pikoro and his change of attitude and tolerance towards the villain.For the creation of a Cell Max should have given more details of its operation, origin, reason for creation and also seems a little out of the story, as Trunks and Crilin finish with the laboratory and destroy everything related to the creation of cell, only take the plans of Android 17 and 18, so it was almost impossible to get all that information.I didn't like it, it's a movie made for 6-9 year old kids who don't need to know the story and laugh at simple jokes.",movie bad dragon ball characters always characterized showing personality movie villain doesnt even say word personalitysome people always story lose essence example bulma leaves aside technology aesthetic things well pikoro change attitude tolerance towards villainfor creation cell max given details operation origin reason creation also seems little story trunks crilin finish laboratory destroy everything related creation cell take plans android almost impossible get informationi didnt like movie made year old kids dont need know story laugh simple jokes
171,As a dragon ball fan i don't even know where to start pointing out what is wrong with this movie and DBS in general.I will try to stick to the movie only.The bad parts:Power levels make no sense at all. These gamma 1 and gamma 2 SOMEHOW are at the power of GOKU and VEGETA who are SUPER SAYAN GODS SUPER SAYAN SSj102021030213 with ease.Somehow because plot requires piccolo and gohan get stronger then them just by wishing and enraging. So basically they are stronger then GOKU and Vegeta at this point. So the 10000x gap was closed in 2 mins of screentime with no actual work.As any other villan from the past (frieza) Cell is refuribished as a braindead crazy d0g who is there just for the protagonists to show off their new power. There is no motivation no intention no feeling no threat.The animation is like it's part of a game while in between fights.The characters feels empty and stupid most of the times.This is just a soulless money grab which adds up to the shame that is DBS in general.,dragon ball fan dont even know start pointing wrong movie dbs generali try stick movie onlythe bad partspower levels make sense gamma gamma somehow power goku vegeta super sayan gods super sayan ssj easesomehow plot requires piccolo gohan get stronger wishing enraging basically stronger goku vegeta point x gap closed mins screentime actual workas villan past frieza cell refuribished braindead crazy dg protagonists show new power motivation intention feeling threatthe animation like part game fightsthe characters feels empty stupid timesthis soulless money grab adds shame dbs general
172,"Like honestly, Akira, you are ruining your legacy. This had so much potential, what is this. Piccolo's big transformation is called Orange piccolo. Like come on man and it's just a worse cell saga. The only reason goku and vegeta were in the movie even for a little while is cuz they're the face of dragon ball super. But they took cell's design and took everything that made him good away from him, and then they had the gall to say that they used Dr. Gero's documents for it. COME ON, HE WASN'T EVEN IN PERFECT FORM. And another thing that made cell great that they took from Cell max is his intelligence. Cell max was said to be complete in the movie he was just beserk the entire time.",like honestly akira ruining legacy much potential piccolos big transformation called orange piccolo like come man worse cell saga reason goku vegeta movie even little cuz theyre face dragon ball super took cells design took everything made good away gall say used dr geros documents come wasnt even perfect form another thing made cell great took cell max intelligence cell max said complete movie beserk entire time

174,"This movie is a breathe of fresh air. High stakes, world ending drama that only the master Akira Toriyama can produce. It is a beautifully written & gorgeously animated story that puts Gohan & Piccolo as its centerpieces. Instead of a typical Dragon Ball storyline where the staples of the franchise(Goku & Vegeta) step in and save the day because only they are strong enough to defeat the villain. This movie focuses more on past supporting characters and allows them to shine as the heros. And shine they did! It's wonderful to see Gohan finally gets to show his true potential & power on screen and not just have it be talked about as a potential in the future. They dangled that carrot long enough. Pan's character arc made great strides in this film. It wasn't a lot, but it also wasn't over the top or overbearing. I'm very excited to see how her story progresses under the teachings of Piccolo(like father, like daughter). Trunks and Goten finally becoming teenagers is long over due and was something I was very happy to see. And the newest edition to the franchise, 'Gamma 2.' Gamma 2 is an awesome edition to the Dragon Ball roster. His personality, fighting style & abilities are not overly OP for an android. Hollywood could take a few notes from this movie on how to introduce a new character in a long storied & successful franchise(seriously).This is a fantastic movie. However it is not perfect. It does have its imperfections within the script, but I would like to preface, my gripes are very minimal & I don't think had these changes been implimented. It would not have improved upon the movie very much. The trailers from last summer felt misleading after watching. I'm very pleased with where this movie went and the areas it explored for the Gohan fandom that has been asking for this for 30+ years. However, I wish it could have been a tad more upfront about this instead of using Goku and Vegeta as its main selling point during the marketing campaign for its release. It's great that Gohan finally was able to break through his ceiling and being pushed beyond his limits. What lost me a bit was he shouldn't have been able to do so, given his lack of continuous training. Piccolo made a strong point of emphasis about this early in the film. He was only able to do so because of the hollywood Vin Diesel syndrome. ""Family."" The fact this franchise was built on the backs of Goku & Vegeta, it would have been nice to see them get more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout its runtime. It would have been nice to see what progress they both made in their training with Whis since their fight with Broly. With that being said, I'd like to reiterate that these are very minor gripes, and changing these things would not really improve upon the story.To sumerize, this was a fantastic story that introduced new characters and expanded upon several of the franchises' most beloved characters. I'm very excited to see how Toriyama implements Pan & Gamma 2, the ever expanding universe of Dragon Ball Super.",movie breathe fresh air high stakes world ending drama master akira toriyama produce beautifully written gorgeously animated story puts gohan piccolo centerpieces instead typical dragon ball storyline staples franchisegoku vegeta step save day strong enough defeat villain movie focuses past supporting characters allows shine heros shine wonderful see gohan finally gets show true potential power screen talked potential future dangled carrot long enough pans character arc made great strides film wasnt lot also wasnt top overbearing im excited see story progresses teachings piccololike father like daughter trunks goten finally becoming teenagers long due something happy see newest edition franchise gamma gamma awesome edition dragon ball roster personality fighting style abilities overly op android hollywood could take notes movie introduce new character long storied successful franchiseseriouslythis fantastic movie however perfect imperfections within script would like preface gripes minimal dont think changes implimented would improved upon movie much trailers last summer felt misleading watching im pleased movie went areas explored gohan fandom asking years however wish could tad upfront instead using goku vegeta main selling point marketing campaign release great gohan finally able break ceiling pushed beyond limits lost bit shouldnt able given lack continuous training piccolo made strong point emphasis early film able hollywood vin diesel syndrome family fact franchise built backs goku vegeta would nice see get minutes screen time throughout runtime would nice see progress made training whis since fight broly said id like reiterate minor gripes changing things would really improve upon storyto sumerize fantastic story introduced new characters expanded upon several franchises beloved characters im excited see toriyama implements pan gamma ever expanding universe dragon ball super
175,"Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero"" brings an intriguing revival of the Red Ribbon Army and the iconic character Cell, adding a nostalgic touch to the franchise. However, the film falters in its portrayal of Cell Max, lacking depth and leaving much to be desired. The new transformations of Piccolo and Gohan, while potentially exciting, are presented in a manner that undermines their significance, failing to capture the awe they rightfully deserve. The most notable drawback, though, is the film's pivot to 3D animation. This stylistic choice detracts from the characters' vibrancy, rendering them game-like and devoid of the expressive richness that 2D animation traditionally offers. While the energy wave effects are visually appealing, they are not enough to compensate for the overall lackluster 3D execution that strips the characters of their life and expressiveness. I gave it a 8 because i am a huge fan but i am really disappointed in the 3D :)",dragon ball super super hero brings intriguing revival red ribbon army iconic character cell adding nostalgic touch franchise however film falters portrayal cell max lacking depth leaving much desired new transformations piccolo gohan potentially exciting presented manner undermines significance failing capture awe rightfully deserve notable drawback though films pivot animation stylistic choice detracts characters vibrancy rendering gamelike devoid expressive richness animation traditionally offers energy wave effects visually appealing enough compensate overall lackluster execution strips characters life expressiveness gave huge fan really disappointed
